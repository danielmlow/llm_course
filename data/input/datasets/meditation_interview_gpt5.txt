INTERVIEW

Teacher (T): So, welcome. Thank you for taking the time to talk today. I’d love to start simply — how long have you been meditating now?

Practitioner (P): About five years consistently. I’d dabbled before — a few apps, a retreat here and there — but I’d say it became part of my life around the pandemic, when everything slowed down.

T: Mm-hmm. And what brought you to it more seriously?

P: Honestly, a mix of anxiety and curiosity. I was feeling stuck in repetitive thought loops, worrying about the future. At the same time, I was reading about awareness and consciousness — Sam Harris, some Buddhist texts — and something in me just wanted to see for myself, not just read about it.

T: That’s often how it starts. And when you began sitting regularly, what did those early months feel like?

P: Chaotic. [laughs] I remember thinking, “This can’t be what meditation is supposed to be.” My mind was everywhere. I’d sit for ten minutes and feel like I’d failed. But I kept noticing that even though I was restless, something in me wanted to keep looking — like I sensed there was something just beneath all the noise.

T: So what kept you sitting?

P: Small glimpses, I think. Every once in a while, there’d be a moment of stillness where everything just kind of… dropped. The usual tension in my chest would soften, sounds would become clear, and I’d feel spacious, like the whole room was breathing with me. It never lasted long, but those moments felt truer than the constant chatter.

T: Beautifully said. Many people describe that as a taste of non-resistance — the mind stopping its struggle, even for a second.

P: Yeah, that’s how it feels. It’s like life keeps happening, but the “me” who’s constantly reacting goes quiet.

T: And along the way, what have been some of the main challenges?

P: Definitely restlessness and self-judgment. For a long time, I believed there was a “right” kind of meditation, and if I wasn’t peaceful, I was doing it wrong. I’d get up from practice feeling frustrated — like I’d failed to control my thoughts.

T: That’s very common. What helped shift that for you?

P: A teacher once told me, “Meditation isn’t about stopping thoughts; it’s about changing your relationship to them.” That clicked. So I began watching my thoughts more like weather patterns — noticing them come and go. Sometimes the sky’s cloudy, sometimes clear, but it’s the same sky. That metaphor really helped.

T: That’s a lovely image. How did that change your daily experience?

P: It’s subtle. I still get caught up, of course, but I notice faster. When I’m anxious, I can see the physical sensations — like tightening in my stomach — and instead of spiraling into “Oh no, I’m anxious again,” I can just breathe and watch. It doesn’t always fix it, but it changes the tone — less fighting, more curiosity.

T: That’s real insight — seeing that awareness isn’t trying to fix the moment but simply to include it.

P: Yeah, and that took a while to understand. There’s this paradox where you start meditating to feel better, but the deeper practice is about being okay with not feeling better.

T: [laughs] Exactly. That’s the turning point for many practitioners — when you stop trying to use meditation as anesthesia and start using it as a mirror.

P: That’s a great way to put it. I think a lot of my growth has been learning to sit with discomfort — boredom, sadness, physical pain. I used to distract myself immediately. Now, sometimes, I can stay with it long enough to see what’s underneath.

T: And what do you find underneath?

P: Often just a sense of tenderness. Like the thing I thought was unbearable turns out to be just energy moving through — fear, grief, whatever. If I don’t resist, it passes. It’s made me more compassionate with other people too.

T: That’s one of the quiet gifts of practice — realizing that everyone’s carrying unseen storms.

P: Exactly. It’s softened me. Even when people are rude or distant, I can see, “Oh, they’re probably suffering too.”

T: Has your practice changed shape over time — in terms of method or attitude?

P: Yeah, at first it was all about concentration — following the breath, trying to stay focused. Now it’s more open. Some days I sit and just rest in awareness, noticing sounds, sensations, emotions. Sometimes it feels like “I” am meditating; other times, it feels like meditation is just happening on its own.

T: That’s a beautiful evolution — from doing to being.

P: Yeah. And it’s strange, because even though nothing outwardly has changed, it feels like everything has. Ordinary moments — washing dishes, walking outside — feel vivid, almost sacred.

T: Those moments of simplicity are often the deepest insights — the sense that awareness itself is home.

P: Yeah, and yet it’s still humbling. There are weeks I feel totally lost, distracted, disconnected. But now I know that’s part of it. The path isn’t linear.

T: Exactly. There’s a saying: “Fall down seven times, stand up eight.” Practice is just remembering — over and over — that presence is always available.

P: I like that. I used to think enlightenment was some permanent state, but now I think it’s more like remembering — again and again — that you’re already whole.

T: That’s wisdom speaking.

P: [smiles] Still working on embodying it.

T: As we close, is there one insight that feels most central to your journey so far?

P: Hmm. Maybe that everything I was searching for — peace, clarity, love — wasn’t somewhere else. It was always right here, in the middle of whatever I was trying to escape.

T: That’s a profound realization. Thank you for sharing so honestly.

P: Thank you for asking. Talking about it helps remind me why I keep sitting.

T: Indeed. The path unfolds moment by moment. Keep sitting, keep looking. Everything is already happening within awareness.
