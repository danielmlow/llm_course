19303,mindfulness,"undertake mindfulness to stop feeling depressed immediately? or does in help throughout the dat I'm new to mindfulness and a little confused. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are feeling depressed/worried etc throughout the day is the idea to try to get into being mindful at that exact moment? So basically the relief from the negative feeling comes direct from the immediate mindfulness achieved? (and so potentially one you go back to normal the negative could come back).

&amp;#x200B;

Or by practising daily does it help reduce the negative feeling overall?

19514,mindfulness,"Meditation/Mindfulness Exercises for Upcoming Difficult Times Would massively appreciate any recommendations. I've been working on a meditation/mindfulness/yoga practice- general self-improvement, but wondering about any practices that people might recommend for the fact that I am about to go through a pretty rough time in life. My partner (and an incredibly supportive influence with my battles with depression/anxiety) is about to emigrate to the US from mid June, for a 2 year research position. I'm currently finishing off my PhD studies. My funding ends in July and thus I'll be living without an income from then until I can get a job (which is a huge source of anxiety in itself, qualitative research positions in academic seem impossibly hard to find). Most of my good friends have also recently moved away. As such- I'm very anxious about dealing with the crunch point of my doctoral studies, with no income, and without my main support network and partner. 

Sorry that was a long explanation. Basically, if anyone could recommend anything at all that might be helpful with dealing with upcoming difficulties, anxiety, potential loss etc. that would be hugely appreciated! I'm a big fan of podcast The Mindful Kind, and the Calm app - guided stuff seems to work best for me. 

Many many thanks.

I've dealt with anxiety since puberty. Treatment didn't seem to work for 13 years. At this moment that makes sense: my fear had another reason. I was afraid I would lose something, missed a deadline or filed in the wrong papers. After my fear got reduced, my pattern still stayed the same: I would lose my bike, my keys, lock myself outside my house, was unable to follow meeting. However, I don't miss a deadlines or appointments. This is due overcompensating tricks. However, when I do not have my agenda and notebook with me.. I'm a mess.

So.. I got an interview for my internship. It was in the field of mental health, so they asked if I had any experience on a personal level with mental health issues. So I explained about ADHD-I. After that I.. they overloaded me with questions if I'm able to do the administration work, the profession brings with it. I had counter-arguments for every question. ""I do at this moment another internship, which has a lot of administration"" and: ""I went to therapy for it, and I use meds. It won't be my strong-suit, but I am able to do it.""

4976,adhd,"Looking for advice/clarification about meds Hello all, I'm new to the sub and I've already learned some stuff about ADHD that I didn't know before. Thanks to all in advance, might be a longer post.

First off, I know I should be seeking medical advice from a qualified professional but with the American healthcare system being what it is I don't even know where to begin to start looking for said professional, let alone whether something like that is covered by my insurance.

I guess I'm looking for some help because my experience with meds hasn't been all that great but I see the majority of subs on here preaching that it's the best/only way to go which also seems to be backed up by what research I've done on my own. I tried Adderall 10 or 15mg (can't remember) when I was first diagnosed several years ago (I am 23M). It worked great at first but after taking it once a day for a couple weeks it seemed to ""wear off,"" not sure if I needed to up the dose or if that's normal and my body was just getting used to it. The main issue though, was the side effects. Once I took it, I had no appetite and couldn't eat for the rest of the day. I would crash in the evenings and get a bad headache and irritability. When I did eat, salty foods tasted very salty (like I was eating straight salt). It was really weird. So eventually I stopped taking it and went a few years unmedicated.

About a year ago, for my own sanity and my wife's, we decided to get me in to see a psychiatrist (I had since moved out of state). I told him about my previous experiences and he started me on 10mg Methylphenidate. From what I understand, this is a very low dose for this drug. The side effects were better and the meds were helping, but then they seemed to lose effectiveness again. And sometimes, these meds seemed to make my symptoms *worse* which I'm completely confused about. And there was a new side effect, my eyes had trouble focusing on things that were very close up or far away, almost like I was going a bit cross-eyed. I talked to my optometrist about it and she assured me that usually goes away after taking stimulants regularly for a couple weeks. Eventually it did, but the other side effects would get much worse whenever I upped the dose past 15mg (under professional advice and observation). And even when I took a 20mg dose it didn't seem to ""kick in"" until at least an hour, sometimes 2 and then it would wear off a couple hours later and I'd crash.

Sorry for the meandering post, I just... I guess I just don't see the point of the meds really. They don't seem to work well enough for me to justify the side effects. I know there are other drugs to try, should I keep looking? I have since stopped seeing that doctor, he didn't seem to be very up-to-date on best treatment practices for ADHD. 

I'd really appreciate any help or guidance from anyone who's been through this before. Thanks so much everyone!",adhd,Lanciferous,2019/08/23

I believe this is the right place to ask this question since I have found a lot of ideas and people I can relate to in this sub. I am trying to improve myself for quite a while and, in general, I know which things should I focus on and what my interests are. The problem is that I can not stick to that 'good beneficial routine' because there are a lot of factors contributing to my spirit at a given time, and I often times feel overwhelmed, and sometimes I simply wish I could overlook things - let's face it if you care about too much, you are not going to feel happy and content. When I try to be productive is beautiful, but that somehow wears off quickly and I find myself falling back to same old habits, wanting to play some games on my pc or do something else which I enjoy but I would like to avoid that feeling of comfort, cuz that's what usually is left after I do said activity for more than an hour, hour and a half.

4230,adhd,"Husband's odd episodes - what is happening? My husband was diagnosed with ADHD about 6 months ago and he was put on medication. For a few years, he has had these odd episodes where he becomes disoriented, confused, and his personality changes. I thought after going on meds and talking to a psych, he would get better but the episodes keep happening. I've described them to his psych but she can't give me an answer as to what they are or how to stop them. He's also been to a family doctor and had an MRI, lab work, and a sleep test - all came back normal. I'm going to describe the episodes here and please, please, please - if you have experience this or know someone who has, what is it? How can I help him? How do you stop it? Can it be stopped?

&amp;#x200B;

The episodes' symptoms: His eyelids become droopy and his speech slurs. He repeats himself or asks the same question over and over. He forgets what he's doing or saying in the middle of it. He focuses on one thing, usually music - he will put on a string of music videos and ignore me and our child and just close his eyes and listen to the music. He becomes very hot and sweaty. He has a glazed look on his face - no expression and completely blank eyes. He won't eat. He walks like a zombie - heavy footed, dragging his legs. He becomes clumsy - running into things and tripping over things. He angers easily and says nasty things.

&amp;#x200B;

What triggers the episodes: I really don't know. It has happened after he has mowed the lawn, or taken a shower, or woken up from a nap, or gotten home from work, or been watching tv - literally anything and everything has triggered these episodes.

&amp;#x200B;

Frequency of episodes: Before the medication, they happened twice a week typically. Now, they happen about once or twice a month. They usually last for a few hours until he goes to bed. He wakes up normal again the next morning and doesn't remember anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of things he has done during an episode: Wandered into the woods, walked past his car asking ""where is my car?"", left things cooking on a hot stove, dropped our child, stared at himself in the mirror completely motionless for several minutes, said cruel things to me, left the house in the middle of the night to walk outside, blares music or video games when he knows the baby is sleeping, becomes extremely irritable, pushed me while I was holding our child, spoke a different language (I think German).

4269,adhd,"The absolutely insurmountable wall of adding tasks to a completed to-do list A lot of folks recommend to-do lists for ADHD folks. I find being able to list out everything I need to do for the day helps me gather up the energy to do everything I need to for the day.  But, it feels like my brain gives me exactly enough mental energy for what's on the list, and if there ends up being more things to do at the end I just physically can't do it.

Like yesterday, my bf and I had decided we were going to go get frames for a bunch of posters we had lying around. The last owner of our place left a bunch of hanging nails in the wall, and after a year of owning the place we figured we should fill them. So the mental to-do list looked something like this:

1. Go buy the frames

2. Frame the posters

3. Hang them on the wall

4. Now there's time to relax

We get to the first store, they don't have any frames, so it's time for store two. That's fine, we're still on step #1. As long as we're buying the frames, I have energy for it. Store two has almost everything we wanted, so we decide to buy the rest later. Cross off item one.

We get home, stick stuff into the frames pretty easy, cross off step two. Hang stuff on the wall, cross off step three. 

Now here's where the trouble starts.

Turns out two of the nails aren't lined up very well, they're next to each other but they're like an inch off in height. Bf mentions ""We should re-hang one of those."" My brain lightly protests ""but we're done with the hanging step..."" but I can shut it down, it's just moving one step back.

Then bf mentions ""Now we should go online and order the frames we couldn't find in the store."" ""No,"" brain protests a bit louder, ""We finished the 'buy frames' step hours ago!"" Despite my assurances to the brain that we had known we'd have to get the other frames later, I can feel my energy draining.

""Also,"" bf mentions, ""Your grandparents have been wanting to see our place, now that we have it more decorated should we call them to invite them for dinner this week?""

""That's it,"" my brain screams, ""That's not even one of the steps! And a *phone call*??? We don't have the energy for this, I'm shutting it all down!""

Which leads to me flopped on the couch, just saying ""I don't know, I'm exhausted"" as I browse through Reddit idly.

There's something just blocking my progress. My mind will not stop running, I can't relax. I just want to go with the flow and feel love and appreciation for things again. I've tried meditation and research and things to change my mindset but it's not sticking. There's things I know I want, but I just can't do them, not without a huge struggle. Even things like making plans to hang out with friends or family. I'll make the plans but i'll be anxious about it. I want to go but I want to stay home but I don't want to stay home. It's like no solution is the right solution. My mind just runs all day and I can't have any clarity or feeling of rest. I'm just so run down at this point, it's hard to stay positive. I've been on anti depressants and anti-anxiety meds forever now, but I just need something to work, I can't just live like this every day it's suffering.

6970,anxiety,"First Major Panic Attack - tips or advice for health/driving related anxiety? Yesterday, I had one of my worst panic attacks to date. I believe it is probably related to some recent relationship issues and me overthinking/supressing some emotions and stress towards the situation. Anyway, I've never felt anxiety quite this bad. It started out with me downstairs in the living room of my home when suddenly I grew very overwhelmed and went upstairs to my room. When I got to my room I started to feel my usual symtoms of anxiety such as a fast heart rate, chills, racing thoughts etc. However, this time I felt pain in my chest as well--which is completely new! I am also a huge hypochrondriac and have major health anxiety...SO, I automatically furthered my anxiety by telling my self what I was experiencing was a full blown heartattack. Now, (I am a 21 year old girl in pretty great physical health with no major health problems) so this wasn't necessarily logical thinking...what was initially anxiety became a full blown panic attack. I was crying uncontrollably and had absolutely zero control over my emotions.  No matter how much my parents would try to calm me or tell me i was simply just feeling anxious-- I was **CONVINCED** it was something far worse. The chest pain persisted for at least an hour and a half to 2 hours, and I convinced my father to drive me to emerg--though once we pulled up to the hospital I finally calmed down and the chest pains subsided. 

I worry if this is an isolated incident or if my anxiety will now constantly reach this level from here on out. I am working on getting my driver's license (driving is something that is immensely terrifying to me) and I am looking for possible ways to get my anxiety under control. Any ideas or suggestions are much appreciated.

Maybe I'm getting an early start into that midlife crisis, maybe I'm being a bit of a twat, I'm quite unsure but I know that what I truly want is no longer attainable unless circumstances change by my hand or another. 

I've been on the job market since April 2010 (I've worked the same restaurant job since March 2007). I've been dating the same woman since November 10th, 2012. I've raised a child since April of 2013 (her daughter came w/ the territory). Honestly, I know I can be doing better. I have switched my schedule on multiple occasions to accommodate my partner's life, taken up financial responsibilities that do not concern me, reconnected w/ my family while becoming more acquainted w/ hers... yet we barely have a moment where I am not entirely ""happy.""

I have some college education, I am attracted yo other women, and I don't desire kids of my own (Seriously, if anything has brought any joy to me, it has been raising this little ratscallion. Nothing but joy!). I don't love the woman I am with any longer because of her lack in desire to better herself, all the bullshit she has attributed to my personal debt, and the lack of an intimate relationship. 

If I were to cut the cord now, I would be working everyday not because I need to, but because I want to. I would be in the black before the end of the year; I would be in a better profession because I wouldn't have to worry about the cost of a certification program or putting money up front for school. But what for? NOTHING!!! The fucking purpose for doing all of this, bettering myself, is all for HER DAUGHTER!!!

I grew up in a broken home. My mother had a poor taste in men, including my own father. As much of bastards he and my stepfather were, I made a decision many years ago that I would do my damned best to raise a child far better than any of them could. Call it Daddy Issues, but I knew what it was like to crave that guidance and wisdom a father could instill. As well, I'm so attached to this kid; I love her as though she were my own flesh and blood. 

So there it is folks! While my partner and daughter sleep, I sit alone at a kitchen table unhappy, stressed, and wondering how to solve this quandary called life. Am I selfish? Maybe but who isn't?

I came back tried to patch things up, but I always got the same reply. ""I'm just playing my video games. I just want to relax"".

This is my first time posting.

&amp;#x200B;

I've noticed that a lot of you have spoken about the frustrations of continuous failure, and how it basically seems like every task we set out to complete is bound to fail, which naturally takes its toll.

I've reached a point where I don't see the point in trying to accomplish big goals anymore. Instead, I've started to basically deconstruct the meaning of life, and how pointless our modern day existence is. It gives me a weird sense of calm knowing that I could just do nothing, whilst others push for better jobs, nicer cars and new skills, and that at the end of the day, it won't matter, because if we don't all die from global warming or a nuclear winter, eventually our planet will be sucked up by the sun.

This is obviously not a healthy approach to life, and my bleak outlook is starting to rub off on my amazingly intelligent, successful and optimistic fiance, who is basically the only reason I still keep trying. 

Everything I do takes so much more effort than others, and it almost always ends in failure, despite the fact that I know I'm an intelligent person. I am hiding behind some kind of nihilistic mask to hide the fact that I'm tired of trying.

4954,adhd,"A weird positive experience with Straterra, hope it's not just placebo effect... I've been on Straterra for only a little over a week. All the websites say effects are generally felt in two to four weeks, so it's early, I understand. But there seems to be a ton of anecdotal evidence that effects of reuptake inhibitors are often felt earlier than the stated averages from the research. A doctor has told me a lot of times those research averages are kind of hedging or being careful in some way. So, anyway. I think it's possible I'm getting effects. (I certainly felt effects from Zoloft in a very short time when I started on that--a feeling of complete ease that I had \_never\_ felt before. A certain constant impending doom feeling went away, and I \_hadn't even realized it was there\_ so constantly until I had this puzzling feeling of ease and realized what had happened only after pondering a bit.)

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway. For the past couple of days I've felt the same kind of pressure I always have felt to do something different from what I'm doing now. All my life while doing something boring or something that gives me feelings of dread, I felt a constant, growing pressure to turn my attention to something-anything-else. This is where my procrastination and detail-dropping have always come from.

&amp;#x200B;

As I say, I've felt that kind of pressure for the past couple of days. Why is this remarkable? \_Because. It's. Reversed.\_ What I mean is, I'll be doing something purely fun and interesting, when something will come to mind that needs doing that's more important but less interesting--and rather than what I used to do, which was to dismiss it with an ""I'll get around to it I'm sure"" and put it in the ""to be dreaded later"" file, I instead \_felt that familiar pressure to do the other thing.""

&amp;#x200B;

So I did it!

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, it wasn't a nagging negative feeling. It was the same pressure I have often felt to do something fun that I'd rather be doing. It was, dare I say it--the pressure that comes from actually wanting to do something.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been not \_making\_ myself do necessary but boring or dreadful tasks. I have been \_wanting\_ to do them. Wanting to do them enough that I would \_interrupt entertaining activities\_ to do them.

I am 20 and at drama school. I have never had a boyfriend and I have a small circle of friends who care about me but they have all gone to universities at different places. I don't know how else to explain it without cutting to the chase but I've realised I can't act because I can't open up and let go. I binge eat every night in order to deaden my anxiety so that I can go to sleep. I can't hold a conversation with people unless it turns into something very dead-pan or about myself. I'm too emotionally fucked up to be in any relationship. I don't really make my family happy. I find it hard to have fun as I don't drink (perhaps a blessing in disguise) due to not having the enzymes.

I just feel like I can't even human. I can't sleep. I can't eat unless it is to stuff my face to deaden anxiety. I have panic attacks over thinking that I have brain damage due to my hypochondria. 

Tidying my room, self care, trying to love myself all doesn't work. I've looked at all the self help books in the world. I went to counselling for a while and I did nothing but cry in my sessions and discovered that I was sensitive. I just need help, but I don't have the funds to get help nor do I have the time because drama school is all day every day of the week.

I find it SO hard to socialise and make friends, I keep my heads down in the corridors and people find me irritating if I go up and talk to them because they think I'm fake, boring and they just don't reply to me. 

I'm considering giving up acting as a career as I don't think I'm suited to the lifestyle. However, another part of me thinks these issues will follow me everywhere in life. I've tried positive thinking and changing my beliefs about things but it jst made my anxiety one hundred times worse.

I have been approved for this for my adhd and tomorrow I meet with an assessor who will determine what things they will give me. People usually get things like special software (and laptops if theirs isn’t good enough), sessions with study skills mentors, transport reimbursement (usually for people with physical disabilities). I will have to explain how my adhd impacts my studies, but the problem is I have been out of education for a while and really don’t know how I will manage. I know I will struggle with time management, as that is one of my biggest issues in my everyday life, but I’m not sure what else. I did well in school, but only because I have a very good memory and never had to study. I was wondering how other people’s adhd affects their university/college experience, to see if I think these things are likely to be a problem for me too. 

Bonus question: what (non-medical) things do you think you could most help you with these issues?",adhd,noomoom,2019/08/26
4356,adhd,"Contemplating asking to switch to Vyvanse, advice/experiences/general info appreciated... So I (31F) finally got diagnosed a couple of years ago, and generic Adderall IR basically saved my life. Everything clicked. It didn't all go away, but things were manageable, y'know? After the testing period, I was taking 10mg 2x/day, after about a year we bumped it up to 15mg 2x/day, and then later switched up a bit to try 20mg in the morning, 10 at night, and vice versa. I'm now finding myself at a crossroads of sorts, I think, though. 30mg/day doesn't quite hack it anymore...fiest couple hours go well, but I feel like it's wearing off faster and doesn't help as much as it used to. 

So I feel like I'm at a point where I can either ask to try something else, or ask to up my dose to 40mg/day. Unfortunately, I don't always remember to take my afternoon on time...if I'm not going to need to function that night, skipping isn't a big deal, but I work almost full time and I'm working on a Bachelor's in the evenings, so sometimes skipping isn't feasible. But if I forget and have to take it a bit later, 20mg will really screw with my sleeping ability when I take it even slightly too late. Also I don't want my body to 'get used' to it any faster than necessary, since this isn't exactly something that just goes away.

I've heard that Vyvanse is 'smoother' (which is good, now that I'm used to the adderall I can definitely see the ups and downs during the day), and that it also lasts longer than even the Adderall XR. It's also, from what I can tell, covered by my insurance. So I'm leaning towards asking to try it out, rather than asking to up my dose.

Pros/cons, experiences from people who have switched, anything like that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!! :-)",adhd,AnarchySoda,2019/07/12

I first talked to my dr about believing I may need an ADHD diagnosis and to try medication months ago. She referred me to a psychiatrist who could not take me because of my age (30). That person gave me the name and number of someone else who also can't see me due to a long waitlist.
I was seeing a gambling counselor at the same time who said he would possibly make a referral if the one from my dr didn't work out but now I can't reach that counselor-Im not sure if he switched jobs or is just away right now. I'll keep trying.

I do have medical coverage at my work and EAP. I know I'll still have to pay though.

Does anyone have a tip if I should see my dr again, wait out the gambling counselor, call my EAP or try reaching psychiatrists on my own?

I talked to my dr about how I've had my own rules in place at work and life to manage this and stay organized but it's getting so hard again. 

My gambling counselor had asked if my family dr has started me on medication and I said no. Has anyone else had their family dr start them?

Then a few of my other coworkers/ friends piled on and gave me a bit of shit about it. This friend also said I shouldn’t have been promoted to supervisor because my customer service is crap, which was probably the most hurtful thing anyone has ever said to me. Everyone was laughing and I smiled through it but it really hurt me and now I’m completely doubting my abilities.

I’m not the most amazing person at customer service but, before this I would have said I was pretty damn good. I always try to help customers as best I can, and, as long as the customer isn’t being a total dick, I will go above and beyond to give them a good experience. To be totally fair, I can get a little sassy to customers who are being rude or abusive, but so has everyone at the party, and they’ve done a lot worse than me.

My ADHD follows me and affects everything in my life.

4671,adhd,"How do you afford vyvanse? Recently prescribed Vyvanse as a change from ir generic amp salts. Found out with insurance i have to pay $290 ($230 with coupon). I don’t understand how it can be so expensive as my insurance only considers it a tier 2 medication, and it has no generic as an alternative. My plan says I have not met my pharmacy deductible of $500, but also says that neither tier 1, 2, 3, or 4 medications count towards the deductible. This doesn’t make sense to me at all. How am i supposed to reach the deductible if nothing contributes to it?

In my EOC it says this:
“Blue Shield negotiates contracted rates with Participating Pharmacies for Drug. If the Member’s Plan has a Calendar Year Pharmacy Deductible, the Member is responsible for paying the contracted rate for Drugs until the Calendar Year Pharmacy Deductible is met.”

But it also says that I pay a coinsurance of 100% after my deductible is met. Doesn’t this mean once my (impossible to reach) deductible is met I’d still have to pay all of the prescriptions cost??",adhd,Garfargle,2019/03/13

Lately my anxiety levels have risen (not exactly sure why), and I find that when I'm just finally drifting off to sleep I will be woken up abruptly by me imagining someone stomping loudly down the hall, vibrating the house, or that someone is getting mad at me. It's accompanied by almost like a drilling feeling down into my head, or maybe that's just adrenaline? I don't know. I also wake up with a tired jaw from clenching my teeth all night I suppose.

My fiance is medicated for his anxiety and I was on Zoloft but dropped it. He has a firm grip on his anxiety and he just doesn't understand why I can't get a grip on mine. Knowing I'm not alone helps ease my anxiety and talking helps as well.

I was fine until my grandmother died when I was 19 and I ended up on the streets. I was in and out of the ER thinking I was dying but it was *drum roll* panic attack and anxiety. I used methods and managed to get myself out of any panic attack. Then I was anxiety free for years.

Fast forward when Im 25 and pregnant. I started to have small anxiety moments about my health and how the birth will go. Not to mention I found out my son has an abnormal heart. 9 months of pure worrying.  after I had my Son 1 year ago, I could not sleep at all for 10 days. This was like when my grandmother died but worse. Everytime I tried to sleep my legs would shake like crazy, my body would be swarmed with a heated sensation, I wasn't cold but I would shiver constantly to, if my brain tried to shut down I would jump back awake. I tried everything like I did before nothing worked. I was fine during the day if I had no pain, but as soon as night hit I fell into a vicious cycle where I would freak out because I can't sleep and I can't try to sleep cause I would be overcome with anxiety including IBS. So desperately trying to sleep while making a lot of bathroom trips was impossible. Also, any time I had a stomach ache or pain I thought the worse. Any discomfort triggers my anxiety right away. Soo I went on medication to help me through. I finally slept normally.

about 6 months later I stopped the meds because I felt better and felt I can make it on my own and I did. It's been about a year of great sleep! I went to work without having anxiety because I was sleeping good.

My son is 1 year and 2 months and he is now sick for the first time in his life. He is up all night screaming and I've been losing sleep ...it's now back. The nighttime anxiety. The worrying of not sleeping, ect.

She drove from out of town into the city to hang out with me. She slept until the afternoon and I had to impress upon her that she would need to move her car parked the previous evening otherwise she would get a parking ticket. For some reason she recognised the problem but did not apply any urgency to its resolution, which stressed me out because I then had to motivate her to move the car otherwise she would get a £65 fine. She thought it was funny how I was getting stressed over her problems. Then, finally, she says that she does not in fact have any car insurance. That is 6 points on your license, £300 fine not to mention the personal liability for any accident or collision plus the lack of responsibility towards others. I asked her how long she had been driving without insurance and she said 5 months. That was a real red flag. I understand that people with ADHD may find it hard to complete complicated tasks or at least get started on them, and I know how annoying car insurance is to complete. But if I didn't want to do it I wouldn't run a car. I'm trying to figure out what here is pure recklessness and what is ADHD. What can you guys empathise with and what is idiosyncratic to her?

19434,mindfulness,"I live in fear of emotional pain. I feel like I can't cope with it. I live in fear of emotional pain, and this creates a 24/7 undercurrent of anxiety, unease, unhappiness, suffering.

I listened to the whole audiobook of The Power of Now over the last two days, and it felt eye opening. I felt like I had a chance at managing my emotions and not feeling so overwhelmed. It was going relatively okay (though there was still that bit of underlying fear that things were going to crumble at any moment and I was going to descend back into the emotional torment I've been in for so long) until, well, exactly that happened. 

I was attempting to sit with emotional pain and allowing it to be there. But I began feeling increasingly worse, though I persisted anyway. I wasn't really sure what my objective was - it felt painful with no point. Was I 'allowed' to say reassuring things such as ""Allow it to be there"", and ""Resist nothing""? Or was that an attempt to escape the pain and thus perpetuate the cycle? It gradually became more and more unbearable until it was horrible anxiety, hopelessness, suffering. It was exactly the experience I live in fear of - feeling assaulted by my own mind and not being able to do anything about it and just live through the torturous experience. I felt betrayed that my attempt at being mindful had once again lead me to this painful experience (this has happened before in recent years when I've tried to practice mindfulness). Trying to accept it felt completely and utterly pointless - if that was how I had to feel in the moment, then that's not a moment I want anything to do with.

So then the cycle repeats. I once again live in fear of the next attack, and then the next. I can say that I accept that it might happen again, but when it does, that acceptance holds no bearing because it's just so painful and unbearable.

I honestly don't know what to do, and I can't keep living like this. I just want to stop feeling like my mind is a threat, because there is nothing I can do it escape it. Am I doing something wrong? What do I do?",mindfulness,crystalcosmos,2019/04/21

I have been living alone for a few years, since I turned 18, and have loved so much of it. 
So often, when I tell people that I am lonely, they tell me that I need to learn to love myself as if loneliness takes away my capacity to do so. When I say that I am lonely, every response that I get makes me feel even more so. 
I dont have the energy, the words, and frankly I just do not have the want to explain to anyone that I feel lonely because I am unable to relate to anyone. I spend my days alone, in and out, entirely. I am lucky to have physical contact (a hug, or even a fucking handshake) every other week. I am even more lucky to have a sustainable, out-loud conversation not involving work. And everyone around me has someone to go home to, whether it be there S/O, parents, siblings, best friend, whatever. 
When I say I am lonely, people will say that they are too, but its not the same. Its hard to watch everyone around me live their lives with other people and I only have myself to share everything with. And no one understands because they’ve never experienced it. I just want to be able to relate to someone. I’m tired of feeling more lonely in a room full of people that I care about than I do in a room where it’s just myself. 
It all makes me wallow deeper into my solitude and it’s making me numb. I cant connect to other people, I’ve stopped feeling emotions toward everyone around me. I care, but only so much that I cant feel it. Being alone has done so many great things for me, but I’m starting to think that it’s taken away my ability to exist outside of myself and how the hell am I supposed to say that to anyone?

Never in my life had I known someone that I was simply excited to see, hear from, find out all about, or want to know about your dreams of the future, and everything in between. Meeting you defined my early college experience. There's no other way of putting it. I gave you my entire identity. My whole self being.

4490,adhd,"Tomorrow I am finishing my last exam of my first semester of Uni, also the first 4 months I have been diagnosed and treated for my ADD. I just have so many thoughts and feelings I need to share, even of no one sees. 1. My ADD is enhanced if not directly caused by hypersomnia, which is a sleep disorder I found out I had not long ago and I think so much about how I was diagnosed. ADD aside I always thought there was something not right with my sleep, and I believed what everyone told me about it just being my teenage hormones or stress or any other reason of the day. Even if I wanted to see a doctor my mother was strictly against it with an that lasted ideology of her farmer upbringing of fixing what's broken yourself. I started having fainting spells caused by stress due to a particular situation once I got here to university. I had never really been to a doctor for anything before but I went to a walk in clinic and filled out the paper. I only put the fainting down, I has no idea you could put more than one thing. I see the doctor he tells me to get out of the situation causing the fainting, then he asks if there is anything else I wanted to ask. I said i didn't have anything off the top of my head and he then told me I looked very sickly, unrelated to the fainting. I didn't know how to interpret that. He asked me how I sleep, made me assure I was honest. A few weeks and several different tests later, I am notified that I have hypersomnia. I had never heard if it in my life, then I looked it up and almost started to cry. I had spent my whole life, unable to move my legs when I first woke up, constantly tired, looking demonic with huge dark circles from as young as 8 years old, and just unable to explain the difficulty I faced getting out of bed. The amount of aggression I took from my family and friends, the way I couldn't focus in class, everything finally was not my fault. It is a sleep disorder where patients for some reason, often unknown, require twice as much or more sleep than the average human. Anytime I didn't set an alarm and i could sleep as long as i could, it was always over 12 hours, usually 14 or 16 but sometimes even got to 20. All I ever head was how lazy I was, how little I got done, how i didn't deserve the things I had and for once I had some voice in my brain that said fuck that, they are wrong. There's no cure, I will always have a body that naturally wants to sleep 16 hours a night. The average human 8 hour sleep that I get most nights is the equivalent of someone who sleeps for less than 4. It wasn't my fault I have to sleep the equivalent of an airforce pilot in heavy warfare. 

2. When I was in calculus class at 830 in the morning, running the amount of sleep deprivation that causes most people to hallucinate violently, I was just sitting taking notes. I had trouble keeping my attention, but I wasn't paranoid or schizophrenic, I was someone who was so accustomed to sleep deprivation that I didn't experience it anymore.

2. I am so glad to know that everything wasn't my fault, I wasn't just lazy, it wasn't just part of being a teenager, it was actually something that needed help it didn't get.

7115,anxiety,"I really, really need a break. Does anyone else feel like they can't work full time and manage their anxiety at the same time? I have generalized anxiety and OCD with a side of major depression, and I oscillate between being able to put it on the back burner and function decently regardless, to letting it totally consume me and make my life a living hell. One stressor I'm currently living with is work. I've bounced between several jobs for the past couple years, all of which I've either hated or haven't been able to keep for one reason or another, and it's at the point that my anxiety is so bad I can barely see straight to work, let alone look for other jobs. My current job, a remote phone-based tech support position, is one I \*thought\* would be great but I'm already realizing it is in fact very stressful for me, and I'm dreading starting work in a couple hours.

The worst part is that I KNOW some of this is just my anxiety talking. I KNOW it isn't just the job. But it's hard for me to actually work on the anxiety while still dealing with the external stressor of the job.

I know life doesn't owe me a handout and I have to make my own way in the world, but with my mental health being the way it is, lately every fiber of my being is screaming, ""I NEED A BREAK. I NEED A BREAK. I NEED A BREAK."" I just want to curl up into a ball.

Recently, I went on a date with someone and even though she didn't want to pursue a relationship with me, she expressed interest in being friends. I said I wanted to as well, but now she's sending low effort one word replies to everything and I'm now realizing she wasn't genuinely interested, she just wanted to let me down easily.

19696,mindfulness,"Pleasant Feeling in the Present Moment I've been practicing mindfulness and really enjoying the little moments I get to ""snap-to"". I'm being kind of playful about the whole endeavor because I'm just trying to have lucid dreams, not wake up Buddha or something.

I spent a few days at work with this great kind of zen feeling, just being in the moment, it was very nice.

But then I had a few experiences of fully realizing the pristine beauty of the PRESENT MOMENT: Like some realization dawned on me, how there really really is nothing but right now! All that jazz about time being an illusion and what not. Its really quite cool. 

Now I can look at the world in this present-moment space and everything feels like virtual reality...its a good feeling but I can't describe it that well, perhaps you know what I mean. I also have this unending love for everyone just because I'm like ""Hey! Its now and we're all here together!"" 

It only lasts for a moment, though. Maybe 30 seconds. I have to just \*look\* for a moment and remind myself intellectually about what the present moment really is, and it comes at me like a wave/snap of lucidity. Its different than just being aware and mindful... its something else. I can't merge the two. Tips on that would be great. But I have a different question.

When I remember about the beautiful present, I get this very very specific feeling inside my torso every time. I can do it moment to moment in a row and it never subsides.

Its like when you go over a tight hill in a car...swoop! This warm, spreading feeling from my stomach up to my chest.

I can look at things all day and think in my mind ""its here and now baby"" but unless I really really snap into and truly remember the present moment, nothing happens. Its so specific. 

Its lovely, but what is it? Why do I only feel it then? Experiences, thoughts?",mindfulness,oculid,2019/09/06

I don’t mind my chatterbox of a boyfriend, or switching tasks to handle something that comes up, or just going with the flow. When I do take Vyvanse... everyone better leave me the hell alone. 

Example: took meds this morning and plan was to finish laundry and then go to the store. But while waiting for the laundry, I got caught up in a debate online. I was focused on reading responses and building arguments. Every time my boyfriend would say something, it derailed my thought process and I could feel the anger building up. Then, somehow it was an hour later, laundry was done, and he began bugging me about going to the store while I was in the middle of typing.

I told him to go to the store alone so I could continue my focus, but I hate that I can’t break away from the focus while I’m on meds. It’s like my brain finds something to keep busy and then can’t stop until finished. I also talk a lot less on meds as I’d rather be up in my head instead of in the real world.

I try to make it short: my partner is lovely. She really is great, but she really cannot wrap her head around my diagnosis and that I am willing to take Ritalin. She is super vary of the side-effects of Ritalin (which are basically none existend for me) and also thinks that the doctor didn't have a full picture of me, which led to an incorrect diagnosis. The thing is that I can even understand her in some way. I get that Ritalin must be scary for outsiders in a way. I also see that the whole ADHD diagnosis procedure is a bit arbitrary and yeah if you are smart you can get access to Ritalin by faking symptoms and by lying on questionnairs. But I was honest. I even showed her the (empty) questionnair. I also know that psychiatrists ""look for the quick solution"" with medication. But that is how things are. I also feel thankful that the medical system in the country I live in makes it possible for me to have access to medication and medical support (although I am out of meds atm). Nevertheless, it feels sad that she is so scared of the fact that I am willing to take medication against my officially diagnosed condition (syndrome, disability, call it whatever). The fact that I haven't shared with very many people that I am diagnosed, makes things even more difficult. I simply cannot speak to many people about the whole thing. Two very close friends. My oldest sister and my partner. I feel scared about the judgment of some of my friends. Some of them would literally not understand I am on medication. Everyboy seems to know it better when it comes to mental health, but actually nobody has an answer for me. I know I mixed two topics up hear.

So I was diagnosed with ADD when I was a sophomore in high school and I am now a Sophomore in College, and this is my first time trying Adderall. I’ve always struggled with school and grades and I refused medication in high school and ended up graduating but didn’t have the grades to go to school where I wanted. My first semester in college was really poor and I finished with a 1.89 GPA and my second semester improved after trying Concerta at two different dosages, 28mg and 40mg. I now have a cumulative GPA of 2.86 and I’m looking to transfer to a better school but I’ll need to get a better GPA for that. In the past 6 months I have tried different study habits and dosages of medication and even tried tried Guanfacine which is a funky medication, I’d look it up if you are unfamiliar with it, and this did nothing. I had left Adderall off the table for years now because my parents had recommended me trying everything else before Adderall because my father who has ADHD used it as a kid and did not like how he felt on it. However; after a failed first year of college I felt the need to try it because I ought to try every solution out there. So here I am about 3 weeks into my 3rd semester and it’s day 1 of my 30 day script of 20mg tablets

TLDR: I’m a sophomore in college and failed my first year and after trying Concerta and Guanfacine I’m not trying Adderall 

My thoughts/questions:

I am on 20mg of XR right now and I feel a little more stable but I don’t feel super reeled in to what I’m doing. I’ve heard from my cousin who uses Adderall that I will never feel “stimulated enough”. How have you guys experienced this?

As a college student I do enjoy drinking and going out with friends, although I am aware of the risks of drinking while using a stimulant, to what extent can I drink while using this medication. To be clear I have no intention is drinking and popping an Adderall. I just wanna know that if I take my pill in the morning at like 7:00 and the day goes by, then am I safe to drink at night, say 9:30-10pm? 

What activities effect how long the daily effects last, are there any catalysts for this pill? If I workout will it burn the effects away faster/slower?

When I am not medicated I am an avid pot smoker. What precautions should I take if I do take my pill and choose to get high?

The first interview went really well, I was invited to a second one right after.

I couldn't make it to their office because I couldnt take another day off and it would have meant that I would have to steal time off my current employer, which I told them I considered unethical towards my current employer. No problem, the manager I would be reporting to actually invites me to a meeting at a pub near my work and takes time to come see me. I was quite impressed by his attitude tbh.

That interview went well too, I got the job offer quickly after.

So they send me all the forms. Now I'm at a business trip in a hotel and don't have access to a printer nor a scanner. Note: I was also very tired due to not having had a lot of sleep so my brain felt very sluggish. I also haven't had a lot of coffee which is unusual for me and might have affected my thinking as well. So I somehow for whatever reason print out the forms at the hotel computer, fill everything out with pen, then photograph each document with my mobile and send the files to HR (note this is a very respectable firm so imagine being HR and having someone send you random pics of documents on a bed). I have no clue why I did that.

No response from them. 1 day later I check the documents and find out that they are designed to be filled out on a computer in Acrobat... So after having overcome my initial shock I do that and send them the files while also disclosing that I have ADHD (although this sounds like an excuse I needed to explain why the fuck I sent them pics of employment forms on my bed).

So currently my brain is in overdrive doing the usual ""what the fuck were you thinking"" routine and also thinking about all the potential ways they're going to retract the employment offer on Monday etc. etc. Not going to get any sleep tonight but skydiving tomorrow might help calm it down. Oh yeah, I also resigned my other job after sending the files so now it's serious job hunting mode again.

4840,adhd,"is it worth going to the doctor to test for ADD? throughout my whole life, i’ve always been known to be distracted by things easily, to get bored easily, to zone out, lose focus, etc. when i was about 8 or 9 i started wondering if maybe i had ADD because of it. my school reports would always come back saying that i daydreamed too much in class and got too distracted by other things instead of the lessons. i was only NOT like this as bad in english, as it was a subject i was very engrossed in. 

whenever i’d ask my mum about it, she’d instantly say that i do not have ADD. she’d dismiss me and i felt as if i was being silly and dramatic for asking. whenever i’d talk to my dad about it, he’d tell me that he feels exactly the same as me. cant focus, always has to be doing something, constantly bored even WHEN doing something, can only concentrate on things that interests him, gets distracted easily, zones out when being talked to, etc. he’d shrug it off and say that i just have ‘his brain’ but never mentioned anything about ADD. i don’t think he thinks he has it, but i believe he does. 

i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 15. obviously, my concentration flunked because of this, and it got so bad to the point that i stopped going to school. i was put on medical leave, given work to do at home, etc. i couldnt do the work at home because i could not focus on any of it, other than sometimes (very rarely) english. i was tested for extra exam time for poor concentration and was granted extra. however, my memory and concentration became so bad that i had to stop my exams altogether and stop working until i got better. 

im 17 now, and still not better. depression is getting worse by the minute, my therapist ditched me, medication isnt working, and im just trying to find whatever i can to help me. i cant get hold of another therapist and ive tried so many medications for my depression that my doctors are running out of options until im 18 and can try adult meds. my old therapist was actually an ADD/ADHD therapist that was for some reason assigned to me for my anxiety and depression. doctors and psychiatrists often assumed i had ADHD, and when i said no, they’d look at me puzzled and tell me that it says on my medical records that i have it. this might be a misunderstanding because my therapist was in the ADHD department, though. 

since depression, i have become a WHOLE lot worse attention wise. i cannot focus on anything for more than a few minutes, i cant read books or large amounts of text anymore (even a few sentences is too much, and i have to get someone to read things for me and explain it) im extremely forgetful, and get distracted by everything, according to my friends. they say they notice i often go off topic mid conversation because i got distracted by something else. they say they dont interrupt me as they can see how intrigued i am by whatever im distracted by and dont want to stop me. they know that i hate cinemas and watching tv because i cant focus on it and i get bored and cant cope. i fidget all the time, i have a lot of fidget toys for anxiety but are also used for concentration. they help, but i constantly misplace them and cant find them for months, so they dont really help me for long. 

basically, i want to see if anyone believes its worth talking to the doctor about. i just want to see if they can do anything to help with my concentration etc, but i don’t want to feel like im just being dramatic and wasting their time. 

i should also add that my mum works in a school for children with issues such as ADD/ADHD and says that she knows what ADD people are like and that i am not one of them. 

obviously, im not trying to romanticise ADD, and i certainly DONT want it, but for years ive been wondering if i do. im sick of being so forgetful and unfocused all the time, i miss reading books, which i could only do if i was interested in them, but now i cant read things at all. i cant even proof read this to check if its okay. my apologises for any errors.

On the way home in the car after getting the kitten the shock hit me. I felt a terrible regret, and the actual reality of the situation suddenly was so obvious.

Every little cry from the kitten makes me feel extremely stressed and guilty. It cries and throws itself on my legs even if I do the dishes in the same room for ten minutes. I feel like I cant sit down for 5 minutes without it getting bored. Its not just this that is the problem though. 

Ive made a horrible mistake and I feel so shameful. My biggest fear now is confronting the breeder with this.

19221,mindfulness,"Need mindful advice on a living situation. How do you find the line between acceptance of what is and telling others to be better? Hello all,

I have a temporary living situation with my future in-laws and, to put it nicely, my mother-in-law is a very challenging person to live with. She lives in a fog of neuroticism and defensiveness and can be very inconsiderate to the needs and feelings of those around her. She exudes negativity and anxiety and seems to have a lot of pain and anger built up in her life. She can have moments of being generous and I think she means well most of the time, but she does not appear to have any control over neurotic and negative thoughts that enter her mind.

Although she does not appear to be aware of how her behavior affects others, she becomes **extremely** defensive and verbally hostile if it is brought to her attention, so it must be in the periphery of her mind somewhere.

I am usually great at approaching these kinds of situations with compassion and understanding, but it becomes very challenging when dealing with “unconscious” people refuse to acknowledge their faults or help themselves. Other family members have been telling her this for years.

I also realize that a lot of this problem is my reaction to it too. It is true that things are they way they are and my suffering is a result of me thinking it *should* be different. For better or for worse, it is her nature to act the way that she acts in every situation. But the thought that she *should* be considerate towards people she cares about and refuses to be called on it has brought forth some feelings of anger and irritation within me (and others) in the past.

How do you find the line between accepting things as they are and telling others they should be better for x,y,or z reason? It’s a hard line to find.

It’s also difficult because the nature of the problems with her behavior are not abusive or extremely toxic, they’re just selfish and inconsiderate. What is the mindful response that is warranted here?

I feel as if many times I'm just pretending as if everything's ok, and things aren't a big deal and I can deal with them, because I can ""observe my feelings and emotions, acknowledge them and move on, or understand them better"" which I think is good and useful, but I'm.not sure if I'm taking it to the extreme.
Because it happens a lot that I may be pissed off or sad, or angry or nervous or stressed and I just wash it off saying ""it's nothing, just  a feeling..observe it and live it"" and I honestly feel as if I'm.not allowing myself to feel things. 

As in today, in which I felt as if I didn't allow myseld to feel sad or cry, because I could ""be mindful about it"", or yesterday, when I was very frustrated and I wanted to scream alone in my car, and I didn't, because I could ""breathe and let go"". Isn't it unhealthy to ""repress"" and limit yourself in such a way? I feel, honestly, as if I'm.not giving myself the chance to be sad or angry or whatever, and in an attempt to be mindful and ""emotionally smart"" I'm.not allowing myself to relax and actually live that emotion. Maybe distancing myself so much from them and observing them so much isn't that good after all, if that makes any sense. 

And this makes me believe that everything's ok when maybe it's not the case and I really just want to cry or engage more intensely with my emotions. I've always been a ""quiet, nicd guy"" so that's how i usually do things, and I feel as if mindfulness sometimes silences me and makes me pretend as if things are fine when maybe they arent, and I want to say something or feel something.

I know, it looks as if I'm blaming all.of this on mindfulness, but I'm convinced that ""mindfulness didn't do me wrong, I did so."", Even if right now I'm feeling otherwise.
Please, help 
Thank you so very much, 

I want to feel more, even if mindfulness has helped, I do feel as if it doesn't at times",mindfulness,kinddes99,2019/10/25

Well with me its also a big chunk of jealousy. If my partner has little to a bit more experience than me in relationships i would feel as if im not cool enough or strong enough or attractive enough and i start judging him or hating it or obsessing about it

19509,mindfulness,"How to gain courage Like every human being I have a ton of challenges that need overcoming. Like most human beings, I don't know how to make myself have the courage to overcome them. I figured that happiness is a great motivator, but I can't be happy enough to want to do things, so I can rule that out. The other possible helpful agents are discipline, time itself and gradual exposure but they're not something you can develop or be benefited from over night and I need a change now. In the end, courage is the only thing that can help me, here standing not for the end of fear, but for the definitive desire to act despite of it.

I already tried understanding my fears and know they're illogical and why they're but in the end I still have no courage. I also already tried harder and so ask to not receive this advice as it is not very useful. Although sometimes trying harder works, it only does so if the person is capable of achieving on her own the necessary skills to make it work. Not everyone has the knowledge needed for that end, in which case telling to try harder may be the same as telling a fish to climb a tree, thus making it an useless and impractical advice.

Now I feel I should give another take on time-related solutions. Like I said, they aren't suitable to my needs but there are other reasons. One of them is that don't want to depend on exterior things to improve myself, I want to do it on my own, and since time is exterior, it wouldn't quite work. I understand time is the preferred solution to nearly everyone, which is why I've inquired a lot of people already but none seemed to have a definitive answer for courage. What do I mean by that? That none so far had the knowledge that really addresses the issue. For context and to help you give good answers, lets consider the issue of ""how to live with sufferance"".

What I've been getting throughout my life is something like ""sufferance is good, so you should be okay with it"", ""sufferance will pass eventually"", ""just stop thinking about it"". It doesn't take too long to realize that these advices aren't coming even close to dealing with the issue. On the other hand, recently I discovered something that did. That would be ""sufferance is like a plain glass of water, is not too good but not too bad either, your mind is the one to make it feel worse than it is by rejecting it because through rejection your brain believes your sadness should be no more and in an attempt to motivate you to make it be no more, your brain makes it feel worse"".

That's not the final bit of knowledge about sufferance as this is no methodic plan and surely more could be said, such as how to not reject. However, it proves to be a pretty useful bit nonetheless and that's why I'd like to have something similar for courage. Or a full-out plan if you have it!",mindfulness,Ptscholar,2019/10/05

As heartbroken as I was I felt it was jitters and he needed some time. After all, it took him 15 years to propose.

I gave him time, three weeks in fact. Carrying on with everything and trying to remain positive. Kept telling myself that he's just scared and would come to his senses soon. That was until he said there was a 1 in 5 chance he would go through with the wedding which was all paid for and only two months away. I was mortified.

A couple of days after that he says he can't go through with it and he doesn't want to be with me anymore. So here I am, sat on my own packing my last 16 years into boxes with the realisation of having to tell people it's off. Well, half of the guests already know but no official statement has come out. It will when his parents come back from holiday on Thursday. 

I've always been a loner since I was a child and that's why I couldn't believe I met someone when I was 15 years old. I'd never had someone I could be honest and open with or trust like I did with him. I had that for 16 years and now I'm all alone. With nothing. I have no friends and the only family I have is a mother who never really showed care or love to me. Going back to live at home is not an option, and I can't talk to her about anything, never could. 

I am once again alone and I feel unloved and useless. A waste of oxygen. Alone. It's funny how I feel completely lost and frightened , but it's the loneliness that I can't stand the most.

One day I started taking Adderall too and I'd still take my daily Vyvanse but then I would also take about 10-30 mg of instant release Adderall for when I would go to class. At first it was great and my grades were getting better for the first weeks, but then I started losing sleep so I'd use it to stay awake during the day, study, or just because I liked how it felt. Eventually I started only sleeping for about 2-4 hours a night. And for about a month I was scared everyone was out to get kill me. I was paranoid and I'd have these hallucinations sometimes(Mist of them were voices), and even had trouble telling my dreams from reality. I was also very angry with everyone I encountered and I also didn't get any enjoyment in any of the things I used to enjoy doing. I stopped doing my hobbies and communicating with my friends as well. I would check the back of my car before driving as well.

I’m very disappointed with myself since it should be so easy to just take one pill everyday but I just don’t know why I can’t do it.

7029,anxiety,"Anyone else have food allergy-related anxiety issues? I have been experiencing anxiety related to a fear of food allergies. I feel it any time I try something new or unfamiliar but it is especially strong when eating in restaurants since I think my anxiety is already heightened in those situations by the social and stimulating nature of public eating.

I will admit that I think it started because my mom has a lot of food allergies. Most notably, she has a severe peanut allergy (throat closes almost immediately) from her childhood and a less-severe shellfish allergy. With shellfish, the allergy/intolerance started later in life (around my current age) and she gets very ill within 30 minutes of eating. I think the combination of being around the same age when she acquired her shellfish allergy has made me more paranoid every time I eat seafood.

I don't have any true food allergies but I do have Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS) which causes my mouth to itch and tingle when I eat certain foods (raw apples, avocado, hazelnuts). It's related to the proteins and enzymes in many fruits and vegetables that are similar to seasonal allergies and hay fever. In my case, this is not a reaction that requires medication or treatment. I now avoid these foods to prevent this problem.

I never really worried or thought about it but in the last few years I've struggled to eat comfortably when it comes to shellfish or new foods I've never tried. I've always been an adventurous eater so this very disappointing. I will take a bite of something and suddenly feel nervous about it causing a reaction. Sometimes I can power through but in the more difficult moments I will go to the bathroom to calm down (and to also relieve any worry that I might be sick). So far, I've never had any real allergic reaction so it makes me feel crazy for being so paranoid.

It's also ruining some really lovely social events and personal moments because I struggle to enjoy a meal with friends and loved ones. I also hate that it's so stupid to be paranoid about something I don't have while other people are actually suffering with real allergies and fears.

I’ve been working on my mindfulness and meditation but my mind keeps debating on what mindfulness actually is.

When an anxious thought arises, I usually identify that it is an anxious thought, stop myself from engaging in it, tell myself it is not a really helpful thought (usually a what if thought) and direct my attention to what I was doing.

But isn’t mindfulness allowing that thought to be? Therefore, is my method wrong? How does one allow an anxious thought to be without getting caught in a downwards spiral or trying to control it?

Also, part of me thinks that those what if thoughts are somewhat “helpful” in a sense that it will prepare me. Without these what if thoughts, how can I be prepared?

I don't really show myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Either I have always felt like a very sensitive person compared to everyone else. Super impulsive. I tried to kill myself once just because I got the thought in my head and I just did it like that. I find I'm always bouncing my legs up and down. I've been depressed or felt bad atleast for the major part of my life. I don't have the energy to do anything or to start anything. I am very forgetful and I lose stuff all the time. When I was at work I must have lost over 100 pens and other shit. When my boss told me to do a very simple task I found that I couldn't even bring myself to start doing that.

&amp;#x200B;

Keeping a job is super difficult for me. I've never stayed at a job for over two years. I feel super restless all the time. Like right now I'm sitting in my computer chair and I am bouncing with my legs all over. If I focus on sitting completely still anxiety creeps up.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading? I haven't read one single book from start to finish ever in my life I believe. When I start reading I can't remember anything and I feel like the text is moving around. I get super anxious and throw the book away after a couple of minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I'm rabbling a lot of common things about ADHD but how can I make the doctors see that I'm suffering here? I'm quite certain I have ADHD. My father is diagnosed with ADHD and he is retired because of it. I don't talk to him.

4704,adhd,"I feel lost. I'm tired of looking for solutions to my problems and I'm running out of time I'm a 16-year-old high school junior. I'm always told that I'm gifted with intelligence, and that means that I'm capable of so much more. I don't do most of my homework until the last possible moment when I'm trying to finish days' worth of late work into a single school night at the ends of quarters. I can't convince myself to go to sleep earlier. I can't get out of bed in the morning. I put off or disregard a lot of what my mom asks me to do around the house. I'm lazy. I don't do a lot of things even when I know I would enjoy doing them.

I've been taking Vyvanse for 8 months. It helps me put more focus into work, and not feel completely drained of energy during and afterward. But it makes it incredibly easy to get distracted by conversation, games, and hobbies. I'll find myself working on homework online when I think of a cool graphic design idea and make that in Illustrator, spending 3 hours on that instead of the essay that's due tomorrow. I don't even like making art when I'm not on Vyvanse. But it's a fun hobby when I'm on it. Vyvanse also makes me put massive attention to detail into things that don't need much detail, like spending 45 minutes on a paragraph for a one-page paper. It's increased my activity level and attention at school, which I needed. But it hasn't remotely been a solution.

I tend to try and justify the things I know I'm doing wrong, which is, I guess, my response to anxiety. Putting off homework gives me anxiety, so rather than doing the homework that's due tomorrow, I'll put it off and tell myself that it'll be fine, that I'll probably have some time tomorrow in class to do it. No matter how many times before I tell myself not to do so before I go to bed, I always find myself pressing the snooze button repeatedly in the morning, telling myself that I'll just be quick when I wake up, that it can wait 5 more minutes, which always turns into 30 and me missing part of my first class (my favorite class too).

I've tried meditation. It gets me motivated for a short period of time but does nothing for me for the rest of the day. And I can't do it consistently because of my wonky sleep schedule.

For the past couple years I've had carying amounts of routine workout. None seemed to really help.

I have occasional little spurts of motivation, some coming from the things I mentioned. I can never ever maintain this motivation or anything that seems to be causing it.

I've heard people say take baby steps, do one thing at a time. I've heard people tell me I need a drastic lifestyle change. My parents tell me to just do my damn work.

These are just thoughts and I'm not trying to make any certain claim about what I can and can't do or anything of that nature. I really need to find a way out of this fast. I don't want to fuck up my whole career by being a lazy high schooler.

I am posting because I want advice from people who think like I do about how to be a good boyfriend (Age 21, in University). I must preface this by saying that my girlfriend (Age 20) is the kindest, sweetest, most caring and loving girl that I know, and I know she will never do anything to hurt me, but sometimes I get worried, and want to try and improve myself for the sake of our relationship and being the boyfriend that she deserves. I will also say that she has not once given me a single reason not to trust her or have any of the thoughts I am about to talk about, anything I think is just my mind being silly.

Sometimes I get worried that she really doesn't love me, and things like that. That she's just settling and will leave me the second she finds someone better, and even though I consciously know that she would never do such a thing, I still worry. And to be fair to myself, it's not like I'm some loser with no aspirations, I have good qualities, I just struggle to see them in myself. Shes's going on a trip to Europe and cruise with a friend (female) and the friend's family this Summer, and for some reason I just have this horrible thought the she'll find some Spanish guy and either cheat or leave me or something, even though I know that I'm being completely ridiculous and it would never happen.

I know that these thoughts and worries are unhealthy and will eventually drive her away from me, no matter how much she loves me. I have been clear and open with her about my struggles and she is very kind and understanding about them, but I don't feel like it's fair for her to have to deal with them, even though she is always supportive and always tries to help me without a second thought. I really don't want to lose her and would like to better myself to be the guy she deserves.

I'm really just looking for coping techniques and how to keep a clear mind, how I can worry less about her and other people in general. I want to be able to enjoy our relationship without feeling so insecure for no reason. Any advice is really appreciated.

4967,adhd,"Keeping a budget while using a credit card Wondering what tricks some of you have found useful to stay on budget. 

I’m lucky enough to have a job where I get paid a decent salary. However, I cannot budget or save money for the life of me, and am spending way to much. And now I’m about to buy a house. While the math completely adds up, leaving me more than enough of a buffer, looking at my recent statements I’m terrified I won’t be able to do it. This last month I really just focused on not spending, eating at home, bringing lunch etc. and was able to cut my bill in half, and leave me about $500 under my max monthly spending. Like, this *should* be easy. But I also know myself. I know I’ll think “I’m fine, I’m fine I’m fine” $10 here, $20 there, until I get the bill then just all out panic and anxiety, and I’ll get in the habit of dipping into my savings until they’re gone. 

I was so much better before getting my credit card and just using my debit card. I had an instant number of how much I had left and checked it before every purchase to make sure I wouldn’t overdraft. But I want to keep a good credit score, so you kinda have to use a credit card. (Or do you?)

For example: I can't think about a summer break, because I am afraid that things will have gone bad by then and all my bright projects will crumble.

Tonight he called our 5 year old a disgusting little girl for eating some butter, and went across the street to drink with the neighbor instead of hanging out with our kids (who are a pain, I admit). When he got back, he started to rather drunkenly tell me he constantly has these fears and worries nagging, eating at him, and that he hasn't really enjoyed a single day in the last 4 years. Obviously this is very worrisome, and I have tried many times to get him to therapy, but he is very anti-meds and thinks that's all they will do. Tonight he told me it would help if I cleaned the fucking kitchen and acted like I gave a shit about the house.

Whew......ok, I clean ALL THE GOTDAMN TIME. He does not. I'm trying to blow it off as a symptom of the anxiety, but as always when we get into an argument, he downplays everything I try to say as me being dismissive, defensive, or pouting. When this was said about the kitchen, I got out of bed and cleaned the damn kitchen. He says I don't listen. I'm tired of this. He says he doesn't have it in him anymore.

If the location of my consciousness is not inside my brain, behind my eyes then where the hell is my consciousness?  It's like saying the information you are getting from your brain is wrong.

Or maybe my consciousness is in some other kind of simulated dimension and is just being projected into my head.

I then go further and acknowledge that these types of fearful realizations are also just thoughts to be observed in consciousness.

One thing I have learned, and is talked about in the mindfulness sutra, is merely being aware of whether you are mindful or not. Then you can ask ‘where is my attention going’ as it is always going somewhere — and usually to thinking. 

I think this is a great jumping off point, even before focusing on the depth of mindfulness and concentration practice. You are being mindful whenever you simply check in whether you are or not. With time, your mind begins checking in on it’s own throughout the day and it allows mindfulness to further encompass your day beyond a sitting meditation practice. As someone with mental health issues, it is easy for me to become distracted especially when stressed or anxious and building this practice has allowed me to bring mindfulness into the much more challenging moments in life.

I'm in my mid thirties, and literally have zero friends. My wife and I got together when I was young, and I neglected any other friendships I did have so she was my only friend during my 20s and early 30s.  Our relationship is in the process of ending, and I'll have no one (which is how it even feels now).

I work at home for a company out of state, so I don't have coworkers I can go hang out with.  People at Meetups seem to have their own groups already, and I've never felt like I fit in.

The past few years I've been working to improve myself by losing weight, stopping drinking, going back to college to finish my degree, and other things.  I don't really meet anyone at the gym because everyone's doing their own things, and I'm so much older than everyone in college so even if I don't care about their age I'm sure mine makes a difference.  

&amp;#x200B;

Some people say they like being alone, and I really wish I could feel that way.  I feel so lonely that I physically feel it in my chest and stomach. I know I'm a good, caring person but it's all just a waste. I've been seeing a psychologist and we've worked on many of the things that hindered me in the past, but I feel stuck at this point. I don't know how I'm going to get through the rest of this year.  I can't be alone on New Years Eve, but I think I'm going to end up that way.  Being told ""Do something for yourself.  Watch a movie you want to watch, play a game you want to play, eat your favorite food"" doesn't help because I don't want to do any of those things alone,  I just want to do whatever I'm doing with other people.  My greatest desire now is to just talk to someone in-person without it being someone paid to talk to me, but I know that won't happen because everybody's already too busy with their lives and I can't immediately contribute anything meaningful to them.

We are a server for meeting new people and making friends, and despite our numbers, we are still a pretty small close-knit group that would love to expand our circle with more unique and interesting people. 

**What Do We Do?**

We are a mainly voice-active community, so we spend most of our time chatting together while we play games or go about our day. We run a popular weekly movie and game night, in addition to a monthly game tournament, art club, Minecraft server, and other special events. There’s plenty of text and media channels to share your interests as well as a variety of voice channels for larger or smaller conversations, watching movies, or playing video games. 

**Our Philosophy?**

While we aim to facilitate a fun and welcoming place for online strangers to meet and make friends, our core philosophy rests on the concept of free and open discussion. This means the staff takes a hands-off approach in regards to the opinions of the users and the language used. At the end of the day, The Glory Hole is all about hilarity and friendship, nevertheless, if you are easily offended, this probably isn’t the place for you as we tend to have silly hazing processes for our new members.

**Should You Join?**

The Glory Hole has provided us with genuine and long-lasting friendships, and we would love to provide this opportunity to others such as yourself. A group of people like this is an amazing way to make new friends or at the very least fill those lonely evenings up with lots of laughter and other voices.

So throughout high school, I’ve been in band and then choir, and I’ve thrown up before almost every single performance I’ve done, and if I didn’t throw up before the performance, then I wouldn’t be able to sing the first or maybe first two songs, bc I’d be trying not to vomit in front of everyone.

19220,mindfulness,"Finding it more and more difficult to forgive myself as I practice mindfulness. I had a pretty rough year last year. I had a year to find a job or else I would have to leave the country, leaving the friendships and relationship and the life I had cultivated over the past 8 years. The onslaught of rejections began effecting me intensely. Although I attempted to ground myself, I knew that the only way I'd fine peace at that moment is to get a job. This made me cave into myself unfortunately and I went into a pretty depressive state. I didn't however acknowledge that it was something that probably needed professional help, I simply assumed I was frustrated. There was a solution in front of me, but it was simply difficult to reach.

I recently had my first breakup. I definitely had difficulty balancing my relationship and the onslaught stress of my job hunt, however my ex had told me he had also been getting extremely close to someone at work all year, he had lied about how close they were all along, and he had left me for her. Although he admitted to ending thing unfaithfully, I still feel a lot of self blame for probably neglecting him. Along with that, I had received a job offer right after our breakup, but I was so raw and there was so much overwhelming emotions and no one at arms length to support me, all my instinctive thoughts were projected at him, even when I knew it was wrong. There's a feeling of being pathetic there that has been difficult to lift.

The first thing I wanted to tackle was my self blame and overtly critical sense of myself. Delving into that had opened up a lot of traumatic things, eg how my parents behavior effected me, how certain events in my life still messed me up. 

Although i'm tackling these issues now, I feel bad that with my hindsight now I could have handled that relationship better. I cannot let the past version of me go.

6612,anxiety,"New to this forum and new (I think) to experiencing feelings of severe anxiety. Would love some help. So like I said, I'm new here. 

I recently have been experiencing some pretty serious feelings of being anxious, with absolutely no specific trigger to set it off at the time. 

A few days ago, I was alone with a man who works in my house, and he had a stroke at 6.00am. I caught it in time, gave him meds to lower the BP and called an ambulance. Everything's perfectly fine now. I am not a medical professional, but I've taken care of my grandmum for over a decade before her death, and she had emergency hospitalisations every few months, all early in the morning, so I'm not rattled by emergency medical situations. 

After she passed in 2013, this is the first medical emergency that's happened around me. I panicked a tiny bit at first, just in order to get the medication and medical help at first, but once everything was sorted, I was totally fine. Calm and collected, as always. 

I only mention this, because this is when the feelings started (to the best of my knowledge). I've had little bouts of anxiety in the past, but nowhere near this frequency and magnitude. 

This all happened on monday, and I haven't slept since. I've been anxious, keep waking up feeling totally crazy and totally restless, can't shake the feeling in the pit of my stomach that something's unsettled. I'll be doing something random through the day, totally ok, and then suddenly, out of nowhere, I'll get major feelings of despair and feel really 'on-the-spot' (even when I'm alone) and I'll feel like everything's kicked into a level I can't handle. 

My hands will feel like they're holding back the shakes, my heart rate increases quite a bit, my breathing is shallow, my palms sweat a bit (typically happens only when I'm anxious) and I just need to hit pause on everything and try and calm myself down. 

I lost control, and I'm struggling to get it back. I never used to have a feeling like this where I couldn't stop it in its tracks. I used to be able to grab a negative feeling by the balls, look it in the eye, and say, ""stop"", and I'd be able to harness it. But lately, it's just been total anarchy in my mind. 

Any tips on stuff I can do to keep this under control? Therapy is absolutely an option, and I plan to pursue it if I can't fix this myself, but any tips on how to keep myself centred during these attacks so I can function daily, and maybe tips on how to keep these at bay?

At nearly 40 I've had half as many jobs in a quarter many cities. I half-assed my way through college, sat out a semester then transferred, changed majors, and started and stopped graduate school. I'm not great at finishing things clearly! But I traveled the world, worked as a model, had lots of fun, worked as an editor, acted out sooo much sexually, all while mostly maintaining the look of an admirable life of ""everything's amazing"". I have never been diagnosed with ADHD, only BPD about 20 years ago, and after 6 months of medication I stopped treatment. I'm sure that ADHD is my main issue.

I'm tired of the lie. Under the cover I'm a mess of unpaid bills, taxes avoided, projects started and stopped, and debilitating brain fuzziness and just a mass of confusion. From a young age I thought that I'd die young, so I was reckless and lived for the day. Well I'm still here and none of my grand schemes are far enough along to give me any real comfort. I still know that I can be great and fix things and win, and I know that I need treatment, but I'll drop that enthusiasm like a hot potato and spend the day obsessing over yet another ""great"" idea.

4878,adhd,"Lol fired again cool (potentially ADHD + narcolepsy problems/come laugh with me at my repeated failure) So I just got fired for the second time this year and the third time in my life, which is pretty fucked up to type out. I had the job for a total of 9 days and it was communicated to me that the reason I was fired was for my lack of attention to detail. I do feel that the training definitely wasn't adequate and I felt afraid to ask questions because my supervisor was insinuating that I should know the answer and had even asked me 6 days in, ""do you really think this job is for you"" in response to my nervous apprehension when he told me I needed to work faster (how am I going to go faster if it's my 6th day and I'm still figuring out what I'm doing??). The mistake I made that precipitated my firing was related to a task that we had just BARELY touched on in training so granted, this could just have been a shitty job that I should be thankful to have been fired from. 

That being said

I do have terrible attention to detail. And I do make mistakes pretty often. And I can lose focus sometimes. And my memory isn't great. And I do ask a lot of questions. 

I have had some suspicions that I have ADD or ADHD for a while. I know a person who has it and I can really relate his experience in terms of his communication patterns and his thought patterns. I also just googled ""why do I keep getting fired"" and it brought me to this engineer's reddit thread who described his problems (glossing over mistakes, asking too many questions, etc) and it was suggested that it sounds like he has ADHD and I was like, ""those are my problems too. 

The problem is that even if I did have ADD or ADHD, my situation is complicated by the fact that I have narcolepsy and take extended release Ritalin for it which honestly affects my focus negatively but it's impossible to focus when you're falling asleep so even if this is affecting me negatively, I couldn't stop taking it or I would be asleep on my desk. 

Literally I'm just like what the fuck do I do. I am very friendly and easy to get along with. I'm a good communicator. My technological skills are where they need to be. It's pretty defeating to be fired over and over having tried my best. Do you guys have any advice for me because I'm going to post this and then I have to call back EI to let them know that their girl will be remaining on the Government dole.

What if he has an infection? What if he passed this infection on me? Where did he get this infection? What if he blames me and accuses me of being unfaithful? What if I’m wrongfully convicted of infidelity? Do I have to spend $350 on a polygraph test to prove my innocence? My funds are tight, where do I get that money right now?

I was a bit chunkier in high school but never actually fat, and decently attractive. I was a bit shy and anxious but had friends (lol). But, no boys ever liked me, even the 'loser' ones. Someone once joked me and a single friend should get together and he was practically disgusted at the idea. I was only ever laughed at, told I was ugly, a stuck up frigid feminazi etc. No boys ever wanted to partner with me on work or banter with me or had any interest at all. Yet girls who were (imo) less attractive and nasty got boys. It's been a while now but since all the boys I knew were shitty to me it's honestly impacted the way I am now. I can't find a bf and I still just have this lingering feeling like they're going to turn and laugh at me, or call me an ugly bitch or something. Call me out for not knowing sports shit or something, I don't even know. I just don't understand what I did wrong?

I go to a cc but i have no idea what major i want. I have no talent. Im not really good or particularly skilled at any hobby or trade.

She had a bf but i was fine with being friends. She told me to keep in touch on Instagram when she left but I messaged her a few weeks after and she never responded and now i think she blocked me because she doesn’t appear when i search her name it made me feel like complete shit and like a punch to the gut.

Ive been trying to build muscle and have totally changed up my diet and done research and have gained many pounds of muscle and i can actually say im in pretty good shape. I found some hobbies that I really enjoyed and while those things make me feel good it’s only temporary and i just end up feeling empty again. Ive tried socializing with people at school but i just dont click with anyone. Im told im nice, funny and laid back but nobody ever tries to reach out to me or initiate conversation with me first.

When I come home, that sense of loneliness really sinks it.

Unlike some of my classmates, I don’t have a girlfriend back home to talk to and the difference in time zone makes it difficult to talk to anyone from back home. I have always been insecure about my looks and height and so have never been very good at meeting and connecting with new people.

My last visit was a few weeks ago in April, usually my appointments follow a routine, get my vitals taken, talk about improving my health and habits : how my medicine makes it so I stay focused at work, not getting plenty of sleep, improving my appetite by dieting, exercising more often, etc. I've only had to go a few times in my life since being diagnosed where I didn't have my medication. Sometimes I feel like I cannot function without my medication. Well at my last visit, I wasn't seen by my usual doctor, the nurse practioner saw me instead. She had me read and sign a contract basically saying that I'm not a drug dealer, I'm not going to abuse my medicine, take controlled substances, etc. Part of the contract requires me to take a urine test, so I took one during the appointment, the other day in the mail I got a bill from the doctors' office. I have health insurance, I pay a $35 copay every visit, $10 a month for my prescription. The bill is $354, but insurance took off $107 for a ""contractual write off"", leaving me a $247 bill, but I can get a prompt pay discount of $24, making my bill only $223 if I pay by the due date.

16942,lonely,"Anyone else actively snub people's advances to be friendly and have conversations? It's the dumbest thing. I'm lonely, and I'm often pretty sad about it. Even still, when a classmate or someone strikes up a conversation with me, I'll go out of my way to end it as quickly as possible. I'm *happy* that someone thought I was normal enough to be friendly to. Maybe they even wanted to get to know me better. So why do I act this way?

Well, there's a complicated cocktail of emotions at play. Anxiety, anger, embarrassment, and shitty self-esteem.

Foremost, I think, is the anxiety. ""This interaction has gone well so far. If I keep it going, there's a good chance I'll stutter or something and they'll think I'm a weirdo. Better cut it off now while I'm ahead"". 

Then there's the irrational anger. ""Fuck this. I've been lonely all this time; nobody's been there for me in twenty years. I don't want you in my life anyway, fucker. There's *me* and there's *them*, and you're one of *them*.

Embarrassment-- ""Fuck, everything I've said so far has been garbage. I've been pointing my weird face at this person for a good five minutes; they've had so much time to think about how weird my face is. I've gotta get out of this situation"".

I know, I need therapy. Or I at least need to start making an effort to not immediately run away from situations that make me uncomfortable. I've just been alone for so long, it's hard for me to believe I'm even capable of maintaining friendly relationships anymore. It's so goddamn frustrating because there are plenty of instances where people are really nice to me, and objectively I *know* that the interaction went well and there's no reason not to continue talking to that person.

19290,mindfulness,"What is Mindfulness and Spotting Blue Jays I think a lot about what mindfulness and meditation do and how to better explain it. Today, for those who are unsure about whether you should meditate or how it can help you, I want to share an example that has helped me.

Let's say your goal today was to go outside and spot a Blue Jay. you would think that this is pretty straight forward. Blue-jays are pretty easy to spot, you know what they eat and people have told you where they like to hang out. So you go out with your binoculars and you start scanning the forest for the blue bird amungst the brown and green trees. 

But what if I put a filter over your binoculars that reduced your field of view? Easy enough, it may take a bit longer but you can still spot the Blue jay. Now what if I were to put a filter over your binoculars so it blurred the lenses? And then maybe I put a blue filter on making it harder to see distinct colors? And then what If I overlaid a checkerboard pattern? Would be pretty difficult, wouldn't it? 

Well when we go through life or have a goal we want to achieve, things like fear, anxiety, stress, anger and other thoughts and feelings prevent us from seeing a clear picture. Understanding how these filters obscure our view helps us see past them and achieve our goals. It also allows us to be more open and receptive to possible opportunities. But that starts with acknowledging these feelings and thoughts (mindfulness) so we can work toward letting them go and seeing reality in it's natural form. This way we can make better decisions, achieve our goals, and navigate the world gracefully and purposefully. That is what meditation helps us do; build mindfulness and practice acknowledging our thoughts and feelings so we can better understand them and eventually let them go. 

I would love to create some kind of infographic for this at some point. Let me know what you think or if there is anything else you think is worth adding. I look forward to reading your comments!

6374,anxiety,"Dystonia/myoclonus-like tics/movements For the past 23 years I've been trying to get properly diagnosed for a strange movement disorder. The doctors I have been to say it is a symptom of my generalized anxiety disorder, though I am not so sure.
They are similar to Tourettes for the following reason. I can supress them, which is supposedly impossible with an organic movement disorder. Also I can somewhat control which parts of my body are effected and they manifest differently over time. Also not usual with organic disorder.
Now, I realize that many people experience tics and movements WHEN THEY ARE STRESSED. However, I experience these movements when I relax. Usually a deep breath will set them off.
Generally, my right arm will shoot up and across my body. Sometimes my hand whacks against my chest in the sterotypical mentally disabled mockery. My head and neck twist uncomfortably to the right. If I really let the movements go, it is a full body convulsion. Symptoms do not lessen over time or if I just let them happen. They only stop when I decide to start holding them in again.
The closest thing I can find is Conversion Disorder, known also by other names, and by some therapists as a trauma response. The theory being that trauma is stored in the body and its the bodies way of shaking it loose. I experienced a lot of bullying as a child, but dont remember a huge trauma that would take 23 plus years to shake out.
I've reached out to various groups and forums over the years for people experincing the same thing. Like i said, doctors say it is from anxiety, but I have not read of other people with GAD experiencing this. I really want to know exactly how to name it, so I can find others to help me cope.

Not sure if anyone ever felt like this but in case you have, you know when you're like four or five years old and it's the day of your birthday party and everyone starts singing you Happy Birthday, and then you start crying and wailing? 

That was me as a child. It got so bad that I told my parents I didn't want to have birthday parties anymore because I couldn't help but feel embarrassed and cry when they sang Happy Birthday. Whenever we do anything for my birthday, I insist that they don't sing to me and most of my family already understands. 

But I'm in my early 30's now and still to this day I get really anxious when I'm being spoken about when other people are around, especially peers. For example, the other day we had someone join us in our weekly meeting. Everyone went around the table to introduce themselves and what they do and when it came my turn, I quickly and dryly explained what I did for the company. My boss was in the room and she was sitting to my left and said ""That's not all that you do! You do this and this and that..."" and then everyone in the room went around and said other things that I did (I'm in a support role for a 200+ person organization). I literally wanted to cry because I was so embarrassed. But everything they said were good things and I feel like I should have felt proud. I just never knew they noticed that I do all the things they mentioned.

My role isn't customer-facing, but I don't have issues meeting people and I do well in my role with managing lots of projects. It's just when I'm in a group setting and I'm being talked about that I start to freak out.

19263,mindfulness,"mindfullness and heartbreak i have been going through a breakup (its been 2 and a half months) and theres been a lot of ups and downs. recently i read the power of now which has encouraged me to start practicing mindfullness again and ive been doing so pretty much all the time this past week. ive been practicing letting myself feel my emotions without jdugement and observe them regardless of how sad or uncomfortable they are, rather than trying to suppress them or constantly keep myself distracted.

in a way it helped me a lot. my mind has definitely been much clearer and ive had WAY LESS anxiety. on the other hand this (as i guess is expected) brought up a lot of sadness and heartbreak that i had been pushing aside and trying to ignore before. ive been practicing letting myself feel these feelings and not fight them, but they're not passing. basically my mind IS much clearer, my anxiety is pretty much gone but now im just constantly feeling this sadness and heartbreak. i'm thinking it is just a part of the healing process and i just need to be patient, but at the same time it makes me wonder am i doing this right??? it just really sucks and i want to be fine and even though i was definitely repressing a lot of sadness before starting mindfullness and my mind was going crazy from needing constant distraction, at least i wasnt constatntly feeling all this pain...

anyway, i would really appreciate some insight or advice or just general encouragement",mindfulness,natalieblue7,2019/03/30

5053,adhd,"My starter-motor fails more higher up my task priority list than lower. Is that still ADHD or something else? It's like I only do low importance tasks to duck urgent tasks, and only do urgent tasks to duck more complex long-term high-importance tasks. And my productivity is directly proportional to how much I need to be doing the other thing.

AKA ""*I* ***need*** *to respond to those work emails* ***right now****? Wow, I* ***really want*** *to get all those minor chores cleared out of the way* ***now****!*"", or ""*I* ***need*** *to run and \_\_\_* ***right now****? Wow, I* ***really want*** *to crank out those work emails* ***now****!*"" 

If the new task is more urgent than the old one, it can free up a high importance task. ""*I'm in the waiting room of the hospital? Shit, lets get started on that FAFSA application I should have done weeks ago on my tiny-ass phone!*""

When I'm self-aware of this, trying to go against it is like pushing against an invisible wall. I don't feel anxiety or anxious, but it's similar to that invisible wall.

4475,adhd,"Review of Google Keep (reminder app): Day 1 I need to up my reminder game for all the obvious reasons and went looking for a good app.  I was attracted to Google Keep because it has location-based reminders that pop-up when you arrive someplace you've programmed into the note.  (For some reason I always believe that when I get to a store I will remember what I am supposed to buy there, but of course that's a huge delusion on my part.)  So I downloaded the app and set up a few reminders, including one for some online training I am supposed to do at work.  I figured that would be a good way to test what the notification actually is like, since I can't really tell from the settings.

17048,lonely,"How I was the 9th wheel for one night. So I (23M) feel like telling the story about how I was once the 9th wheel. I do want to clarify a few things though. First, I'm not looking for people to feel bad for me as this happened years ago and I laugh about it now. Second, I'm currently don't feel as lonely as I did when I was 19 when this happened, but I do consider it one of my loneliest times in my life. Third, I hope that this helps people who feel lonely know that it does eventually get better.

So this was either my first or second semester in college and break was coming up. I had a group of friends back then and I talked to one of my friends who lived in the dorms to about having a movie night with pizza before break starts since some of the people in the group lived hours away making it hard to hang out. Since I considered myself the host I offered to buy the pizza and bring the movies. When getting the other people in the group to come most were able to go. Now this wasn't anything really new as we've done stuff like this before, but the only difference is that most of the people in our group were in a relationship with either someone else in the group or someone outside of the group. I was not one of those people.

Now, I obviously invited the other single people in the minority of the group with them saying they'll try to go but might not be able to. For a week leading up to the movie night I was thinking to myself ""man, wouldn't it suck if I was the only single person at the movie night"" well let's just say welcome to self fulfilling prophecy. None of my other friends who were single were able to come so movie night was 9 people with 8 of them with their SO. In other words I pretty much created a quadruple date for my friends. Congratulations past me, you played yourself.

Now I'm someone who doesn't like to ask people to give me money and I already offered to pay for the pizza so not only did I set up a quadruple date, I was paying for it *epic facepalms*. Now because the pizza place we were ordering from was too far away to get delivered I went to grab the pizza alone which was kind of a good thing. On the way to the pizza place I remember crying almost the entire 25 to 30 minute drive there as I felt completely distraught. I kept asking myself all the questions like ""why can't I get a gf?"" And so on but in an ugly crying tone. I still ended up having to wait for the pizza to be made when I got there which was definitely a good thing because it gave me time to collect myself. On my way back I did eat a couple of slices, because I paid for the pizza, but I was wondering if I was even missed or if my friends knew how lonely I felt.

When I got back I tried my best to act happy and like I was having a good time. I couldn't really leave early because I was the host. I don't remember much specifics after that other than a few things. During one of the movies all the couples were cuddling with each other during one if the movies and I had to just try my best to ignore it and focus on the film. One of my friends there jokingly asked if I wanted to cuddle with him and his boyfriend. I probably answered with something like ""nah, I'm good."" In a positive manner or as close to positive as I could produce. As the night ended I was left to clean up with my friends helping out but I left the dorms feeling sad and tired.

Afterwards, the one friend whose dorm building we were having it in mentioned that he and his gf at the time noticed how I was kind of left out socially. Now, like I said I laugh about it now even though I still don't have a gf I learned to get over it and try to enjoy life as is with the close friends I have. If there's a moral of the story I guess it would be either don't let your relationship status stop you from enjoying yourself or don't set up a quadruple date for your friends without you having a date yourself. If you made it this far thanks for reading, it feels good to get this stuff out.

TL;DR: In college I set up a quadruple date for my friends where I was the host and paid for it.",lonely,Kaiju1964,2019/09/23

For a moment you lost your breath
And everybody is leaving you once again
Nothing's real when the diamonds turn to stone
Call me, let me be the one
That makes you forget the shades in your cold room
We are on the edge together, and that feels right

[Chorus]
Go ahead, cry
I know you feel it too
‘Cause some things last forever
Some things last forever
Go ahead, cry, I know you need it too
If no one loves you better
I will be waiting here for you

Go ahead, cry
I know you feel it too
‘Cause some things last forever
Some things last forever
Go ahead, cry, I know you need it too
If no one loves you better
I will be waiting here for you

Breath out
Tell me anything you want
They don’t need you but I'd give

19378,mindfulness,"I made the jump to pursue my dream as an artist / filmmaker. It means taking a lot of shit for a lot of years - what I've been doing is comparing the struggles I have today to the struggles I had a year ago, and it makes me appreciate my problems as a sign of progress. Also, Kendrick. Mindfulness is something I've been really working on - while I've had a lot of really promising career moves and successful moments, I think a lot of my loved ones don't see that I'm a duck. Above the water I am moving forward calmly and at a steady rate, but below the surface I am paddling with all my might just to stay afloat. 

I've noticed since moving away from my home that some demons are popping up, ones that I haven't had before (which makes sense. New life, new path, new challenges.) Recently they've been getting the best of me, if I'm honest. But this new perspective I'm trying to take - the one where I am appreciative of the opportunity to have problems like these - feels like the right move in silencing those new demons. Or at least separating them from the front of my mind. 

While I don't wanna spend the time talking about what those demons are, in short they are the following: family / friendship obligations from a distance, comparing myself to masters of the industry, questioning my own work, being a hypocrite. The reason I mention them outright is so I can present to you how this passage off of ""To Pimp A Butterfly"" by Kendrick Lamar literally drove me to tears today, and brought me back to focusing on mindfulness:  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it  
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city  
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive  
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly  
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar  
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak  
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits  
Already surrounded by this mad city  
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him  
He can no longer see past his own thoughts  
He's trapped  
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots  
Such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city  
The result?  
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant  
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations  
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle  
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different  
They are one and the same

My partner is going through some stuff and mindfulness has been suggested to him. However he is very logical and can be very skeptical and finds some of the videos he has found to be very fluffy and in his words ""too hippy dippy to take seriously"". 

He is very much someone who appreciates the science in things so I didn't know if anyone knew of any videos or audios that incorporates the science of mindfulness into their stuff. He is highly suggestible at the moment and dealing with trauma and has found that a lot of stuff he has looked at uses rather words and phrases like ""recognise your true desires"" and ""recognise your passions"" which were massively distressing for him.

I lost my new pandora bracelet, and I know I left it hidden under papers on my cart. I forgot it when I left work that day, but knew I was coming back the following day. I didn’t think anyone would take it or even see it. (Stupid me) I looked through lost and found and the office, but no luck. The general manager is looking through the cameras to see what happened.

Then my boss caught my supervisor stealing my tips the very same day. Nothing was said to her. And I was told to keep an eye on her.

Then there’s a laundry lady who’s been giving me attitude and a hard time everyday. She called me a ‘nobody’, I shrugged it off thinking it was a joke. Then she argues with me about why can’t I take stuff back to the kitchen. (I tell her we are NOT allowed back there) And the kitchen staff grabs the items.
Then today she yelled at me for giving her dirty linen. She said ‘why the fck would you throw these down?! You throw these in the fckin  garbage!’ It’s her job. She does laundry. I help with laundry. I inspect the linen. They were FINE.

At this point I was fuming. I had had enough and didn’t even say anything back to her. (I knew I would say something stupid and couldn’t control my emotions in this moment.)

Complaining about your parents in my age is a normal thing, right? But when I do that, I just make my friends concerned about me.
But it's not like I know what to compare to, and it feels like this is normal. I want to keep it kinda short, but if you feel that I missed out on something important, please comment and I will tell more in detail.

My mom has, some toxic parenting traits. But she's a very nice mom, usually. I think. But I don't know where the line draws. Where is bad personality traits start being considered toxic? When is parenting start being abusive? 
Taking silent treatment as an example. Toxic right? But I don't think it's that uncommon. I haven't personally met someone who has experienced it, but it doesn't feel like something that would be so rare.
But last time I got it was when I was 12, so 3 years ago. But if we take something a bit more common? Picking on one's appearance. Not toxic? But how much is the considered toxic? What about guilt tripping? Manipulation?

My friend told me I should try at least reading into child support. And maybe moving away. But it feels like that would be overreacting. I've read a lot about above parents, and sure my parents book off a lot of check marks on the traits list. But still, it's at that lvl when it's too much to ignore and it affects my mental health...I think? But wayyy to little to searching help and even moving away. My parents would never accept me back if I did that. That's why I feel like I'm overreacting",anxiety,friedmayonnaisesoda,2019/10/15

To be honest, I feel like this wording completely undermines the definition of mindfulness and dilutes the practice in that it is not referring to noticing the sensations of the body, being aware of movement or the breath, and noting thoughts and feelings.

To make it short for everyone I have been on cipralex (Lexpro) for 3 years, under doctor supervision I’ve been weaning off my 10 mg dose. For the last 4 months I’ve been taking 5mg and for the last 2 weeks I’ve switched to 2.5 (also under supervision) 

During the second week I’ve started experiencing a symptom I had before starting cipralex 3 years ago, which is the feeling of being out of breath and unable to take deep breaths. If I tell my doctor that he’ll probably up my dose and postpone going of cipralex completely, I really want to stop taking the med after all these years.

So I have a seasonal hobby, I can do it outside the snowy winter months. I have a cookie for whoever guesses it :)

Anyway it's the only thing that got me out of my seemingly severe anxiety and depression, it's the thing that I live for. This winter is the first one I've had since starting, and its been hard. Really hard. Week after week I get more anxious over mundane things. As an example: ""Oh god, I have to sign in to check my assignments and grades"" That anxiety haven't happened in almost a year and its back. These creeped back into my life without me noticing.

I recently got a girlfriend, gee this really showed me how fucked I am and while I barely know her too. What a wake up call. For a while, all day I was thinking ""does she really like me? Am I going to say something dumb? When will she reply? I need to see her."" I never thought like this while dating when I had my hobby, instead of thinking about my hobby all day im thinking of her and can't stop, honestly it's toxic. She's great, I'm obsessive.

Now almost every second of the day is agony. I can't focus in class even. I have no motivation even for things I was madly passionate about 3 months ago. It makes me wonder if this is all worth it, what the hell do I have left?

I love people, I love talking, I love giving people hugs even when it's awkward. I have all but 2 semi real friends after going to college. I barely have human contact.

I have a question but I am pretty embarrassed to talk about this, as I feel really dumb in hindsight.

So I was put on Sertraine 25mg back in March. I didn't start til April - I am very anxious around medication and became obsessed with the idea I would develope serotonin syndrome from this dose. So, when my anxiety overwhelmed me with fear of getting sick from the medication, I'd skip a dose. I never did it for long in a row - It was usually I would miss a dose one/twice a week, a few days apart. I was on cipralex years ago and I occassionally forgot my pill, but it never affected me in any ways I was aware of.

Anyway, I finally decided I have to stop being scared and just force myself to commit. I've been on the pill everyday at the same time for over 4 weeks now. I am feeling better but not 100% - Calmer, the sticky thoughts float away more easily, cry much less, appetite is better and energy is better.

So my question is - Could skipping doses the way I was have made the medication not as effective as it should have been?

I go in for my first appointment.  Sit down and talk with her for about 45 minutes.  I explained my struggles / etc and that I felt like I may have ADHD-inattentive or whichever was ADD without the hyperactivity.  She says there was a difference between ADD and ADHD and that's when I kind of started questioning things.  Everything I've read says ADD is an outdated term and its all ADHD but anyways..  She has me fill out a questionnaire type thing (google adhd self test and its literally one like that).  Filled it out, she asked if I had any questions. Glanced over the 'test' and said she believes medication would benefit me and gave me 2 rx.  1 for adderall tablets and 1 for adderall XR.  She never actually diagnosed me with anything.. just said meds will benefit me and that was that?

Filed an official complaint against a dental hygienist's  inappropriate comments/ questions about my daily SNRI and use of other medications. I've been at this small dental clinic for 7 years, and they've frequently cycled through hygienists. This new gal made the most obnoxious comments about my medications and asked incredibly intrusive questions about lifestyle, despite my numerous attempts to evade them. She openly admitted multiple times that she doesn't believe in medications, and there were several other moments of unprofessional behavior that I was extremely affected by. 

I would normally never say anything and would just transfer care, but I legitimately fear that she'll make other patients feel as badly as I did with her chairside manner. So, I put on my best administrative-bossbitch hat and wrote the dentist and his office manager, despite my fears of complicating our relationship.

I'm proud of myself for actually trying to stand up for those who need medicine to combat traumatic childhoods / chemical imbalances that cause significant impairment to daily life. No one should leave a dental hygiene appointment feeling persecuted for their regimen. I felt a little unjustified that I had to leave out my personal experiences in order to come off as professional,be taken more seriously and not be dismissed as oversensitive. 

I'm feeling anxiety about the issues she made me talk about, her reaction/demeanor during the discussion, and my fear of being written off as just a 'whiner.' However, no one should feel as negatively as I have for the 24hrs since my appointment.

I live in NYC but grew up in suburbia and have found my anxiety has increased tenfold since moving to the city a few years ago. Constantly being surrounded by people, buildings, and—what I find the most pervasive—advertisements makes it really hard for me to feel grounded and enjoy life.

I’m wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences when moving to a place like NYC and more broadly, in this media saturated moment...

The easy way out would be to leave the city but I don’t want to deter my life and my goals by giving into my anxiety. 

I would appreciate any suggestions on practices or even books that may be of help. 

Thank you :)

I've lived here for over 3 years now and I have 1 friend who rarely reaches out but I'm really grateful for her irrespective of how much we spend time together.

I grew up from a middle-class family, but I decided to invest in cryptocurrency three years ago. After Bitcoin came shooting up in price, I decided not to pursue school anymore due to wealth. So, I decided to learn cryptocurrency trading and I day traded over two years every single day. It was wake up, trade, eat, sleep and repeat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, since I grew up as a middle-class family; everyone in the family tree is like WOW! Who's this wealthy boy. They all want to use me as their ""sugar daddy"" suddenly when I grew up they weren't supportive at all. You don't know how much pressure they put on me when I'm near the '20s and tell me I should buy a house for them to flex to their friends; Meanwhile, I barely have any except 1-2 because I fucked up in Life and I want to cry because I can't since it's my fault. 

&amp;#x200B;

I fucked up &amp; I hate life because I am an introvert and has low blood pressure, have migraines now, and then, that feels stupid because I'm not going to school like my old friends/normal friends since I don't have the grades to apply for a good university. You guys might think this; My life is way better than yours. Not when you don't have friends, low blood pressure like when you wake up feel light-headed, sometimes faint/blackout out of nowhere or feel utterly weak. I have a luxury car and such, but I don't want to be a dickhead to society and spend money on a Ferrari because I have no friends to show to. And feeling stupid while being dumb rich is worse because one of my family members is the smartest person in computer science in one of the universities when he talks to me. It's like what the fuck are you talking about Or makes my mind GO BOOM.

&amp;#x200B;

Last Year, When I found the love of my life despite there were so many red flags about her, and I got rejected due to her having a boyfriend, and she confessed a day later while having a boyfriend?! ( Oh fuck no. ) After that everything went down... I lost almost all my friends and still lonely with no girlfriend to the present day ( today ), and I tried to day trade; the day after I got rejected, I lost everything 90% of the amount I invested ( It was about 5% of my money ) because I forgot to triple check my selling price, I enter 1, less zero.

For example, I sped down a street at 100 km/h in a 50 zone, and I pulled up beside a police car. At that moment, I thought I was fucking toasted but nope! I didn't get caught for some reason, and I don't know why. I just smiled and waved at him, and he nodded.

6271,anxiety,"Anxiety about being a Groomsman - Possible Trigger Warning. First post to reddit, and I chose r/Anxiety for it! 

I’ve dealt with anxiety since I was 7 years old and developed a severe phobia of being physically ill. In High School I grew out of it, unmedicated, which I attribute to being younger, easier to distract, and essentially being forced to face my fears by adults. 

When I graduated college a few years ago, anxiety hit me again, hard. I was physically sick this time, I actually thought it was gallbladder issues or something more serious as I’d never had physical symptoms from anxiety. This heightened anxiety was so bad at times I became reclusive, had trouble talking while ordering at drive thru’s and had difficulty going to work. I’ve been taking Lexapro and dabbling in exposure therapy to prove to myself that I won’t be sick. 

Now at the age of 28, I’ve bailed on one of my friends weddings and have now been asked to be a groomsmen at another friends wedding. I’m tired of letting my friends down and really want to be there for them on their special day. The wedding is at the end of April, in another state and I’ll find myself lying awake at night, getting that tickle in the back of my throat, just thinking about it. 

I know that no one will be looking at me, but walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid, standing in front of a crowd, what if I make a mistake, what if I get the urge to be sick, essentially all sorts of “what-ifs” are rolling through my mind. 

I’m asking because I’d love to hear some advice on how some of you have tackled these tough situations. I’m considering seeking out medication from my health care provider to help me through this event but I’ve never asked about that sort of thing. All I can think of is the John Mulaney skit where he seeks out Xanax and ends up getting his prostate checked. 

Thanks for listening! Any helpful input is appreciated!

The issue is my pharmacy (local walgreens) will not fill my prescription until the day it was dispensed last month. My last refill was 6/24, and they wouldn’t dispense until today (25th).

This is not just inconvenient and annoying, but I run short on medication. I don’t know if this is just my pharmacy? Is this a federal policy? I’ve talked with the pharmacist and she says this is just the way it is.

I feel like it's hard to get correctly diagnosed when it's done by questions and answers, and not by doing a blood test or something similar of that nature. Sure, I actually do have quite a few symptoms, but how can you not sometimes think of it just being you? How can you not feel like 

As for the topic of the thread- stuttering, and just really hard to understand speech in general has caused me tremendous amount of pain throughout the years, and has led me to being that suicidal 'isolated loner'. I have went to a few doctors to seek some sort of help or ways of dealing with it, and all of them have said them same: ""just relax bro, don't stress"". Which is quite stupid of them to say that because you can't simply just use sense to make a neurological issue go away like that. And either way, it doesn't matter the situation I'm in, or how stressed out I'm, the stuttering and horrible speech will still be there.

I've never done drugs in my life, heck I never drank alcohol or even tried smoking, but after reading a bit about adderall, and how it has helped people that have adhd to speak more clearly, let's just say it definitely made curious if this is the thing that I'm looking for.

I feel like I spend so much time worrying about how much time I'm wasting doing nothing, that I truly end up without any time to actually do anything?

For example, today I worked 4-9. Short, sweet shift. But from the time I wake up to the time I have to start getting ready for work, all I can think about is how I want to cram as much time as possible being productive before I have to get ready, and how little time there actually is for me to do something ""worth while.""

Biggest problem is, I don't know what exactly I want to be productive on. I have a couple long term and short term goals that I'd like to meet, but like I said, I spend so much time worrying about work and what to spend my time doing that by the time I need to get ready, I've done squat. I can seem to isolate one goal at a time..?

I'm not gonna lie, the sun going down so early has really messed with my depression. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has any shared experiences or advice for this kind of thing? I know I need to implement a routine, it's definitely not there yet. Any attempt I've made seems to kind of fall through and I just say ""eff it, I'll start over eventually.""

19601,mindfulness,"On the cusp of “I” I’ve been in a little loop today. I found a moment where I am not my ego. It then inspired me to ask.... then what? It’s an internal contradiction. I can feel my ego containing..... something. What is this internal battle? Is this the ego that I just became really aware of keeping me? What is there that it’s trying to keep? I still have a language barrier in my mind. 

It says I won’t be able to meditate. How to I “break through” that and let the idea of mediation stop? There’s a physical feeling in my head of containment. How do I let that be and meditate when the struggle with it is prevalent?

I became blindingly aware of it. How do I then exit the ‘fight’ it’s having with.... me...?

4481,adhd,"Is remembering names, faces, places also a hell for you? I really have difficulties to remember anything, if I don't write it down. After being introduced to someone, I forget the name right away. Yeah that can be normal, but even after remembering the name once successfully, I will forget it again. When I will see this person the next day, I probably won't recognize him by his face. I even forget names of people that I know for years or decades.

 I have the same difficulties with places or details. I can describe a path to a friend through a city by telling him take left and take right, but I never have specific buildings or name streets in my mind.

Also, I am not able to name colors of places that I have been very often. It's just an information that is not saved in my brain.

When I start to do something, I can be distracted very fast. Because of this finishing tasks is not my thing. I leave everything started, but do not finish a task very soon.

The only thing that has helped so far, is to reduce the workload of a day by tackling only 1 or 2 things a day.

I am currently suffering from depression and anxiety after having a drug induced psychosis so it could be caused by that, too. But I have most of these problems since my childhood.

19050,mindfulness,"Why People Choose NOT To Work On Self-Improvement? A coworker and I were just chatting about Reddit, as she didn’t know what it is all about. I described it to her, and she responded with, “well, I better not go on there - I don’t do well with other people’s opinions.”

This coworker, while I get along well with her, is known to “not play well with others”. She is known to be frequently loud, boisterous, confrontational, highly opinionated, and argumentative. Her tone typically can be read as being disrespectful. 

But here’s the thing; she is often self-aware to these points. She has admitted them to me in conversation. No - she doesn’t practice meditation, but she does display (at least some) mindfulness of the personality traits that could be perceived as being limiting. 

Why do you think some people make no attempt at (for lack of a better phrase) “improving themselves”?
Why don’t more people, who notice things they have difficulty with, don’t try to overcome these obstacles?

My theory deals with how we label/identify ourselves. We become so comfortable and accustomed to how we see ourselves that (sometimes) we don’t want to change - because we see ourselves as “this way”. If we change, we will no longer be ourselves. It’s a form of control, maybe?

In the dream our baby was having trouble getting to sleep. My husband was clearly frustrated and frantically trying to get the baby to go to sleep ( as I often do). I asked ""What can I do for you?"" (as he often will ask me). His reply was like mine is a lot of the time. Without looking at me, he picked the baby up and said angrily ""No, I got him!"" Looking very angry, he strode into the bedroom and shut the door; leaving me alone in the living room.

I felt scared and sad. I thought to myself, ""Geez, I was only trying to help."" In my waking life, it somehow never crossed my mind that my husband could feel that way. In my cluttered mind, I assumed that he would be angry for a moment, but then feel relived that he didn't have to do anything.

19265,mindfulness,"Mindfulness Energy Consuming Hi everyone, how are you doing today?

I’ve been interested in mindfulness and trying to become best version of myself for a few years now. Everyday I’m doing my best to be  more mindful and really be engaged and fully immersed in everything I’m doing. But here is what I found most challenging. Some days I’m really in the flow, but there come days that where it saps my energy being so conscious all the time, it feels like I’m more exhausted and it’s hard to maintain it, so I slowly just slip back into the “autopilot”. I’ve learned that I should accept this feeling and not try judging it, which is the deepest layer for me it seems, if I try to fight it in a pursuit of being happy and forcefully trying to avoid feeling like shit, it just creates more tension and division in me. But on the other hand, with every practice we do, we try to learn a new pattern and because our brain likes what it’s most familiar with, from long years of conditioning , we slowly go back to old ways, just because we’ve been doing it for so long and it’s. So, I’ve come to a point where I don’t know what should I do, when I feel so drained of energy? Why? Is being mindful throughout the day really supposed to be so energy consuming? I’ve had glimpses of flow states in the past, where they would last for days and I had more energy than ever, couldn’t even sleep more than 5 hours. Do you think there’s an underlying cause and how can I discover it?  Thank you very much for your help.",mindfulness,Cosmosus_,2019/04/10
17169,lonely,"Happiest I've Been In Years, But Missing A Connection I got out of a 9 year relationship about 8 months ago. Truthfully, I should have ended things with my ex years ago. I was absolutely miserable for the last couple of years. But I'd somehow convinced myself it was better to be with somebody and miserable than alone.

Once I got out though, I felt a happiness and freedom I haven't felt in so long. I'm getting to do all the things I never got to do while I was in that relationship and have started doing things for myself again. And I've not been this happy in literally years. 

But I'm missing having an emotional and intimate connection with somebody. Honestly, I miss the physical connection as well. Like a lot. My libido took a nosedive over those last couple of years and I had zero sexual desire. But now that I'm single again, I feel like I've got the libido a 15 year old boy again. But more than anything, even though I'm not looking to jump straight into a relationship right now, I miss having that intimate, emotional connect that comes with getting to know somebody on a deep level. 

I can be a bit of an introvert so meeting new people is sometimes -- okay most of the time -- difficult. I'm not the spot a woman across the bookstore, walk right up, and introduce myself kind of person. But once the ice is broken, things are great. 

It's just meeting somebody who can help me break the ice that's the problem. This is the problem with being me -- well, one of them anyway. I wish I could be that person. I'm happy as hell and I'm just wishing I had somebody in my life to share that with.",lonely,spilledink2018,2019/07/29

It seems with every day I see with more clarity the things I messed up.  I'd hit a rut of family stress/anxiety and I believe my medicine caused me to check out of the relationship for a while.  

My so at the time started working more hours and became resentful that I hadn't been doing more around the house, and was just generally being less romantic and attentive.  We'd been together over a year and this would have been the last 6 weeks of our relationship.  I had no idea she was unhappy, though I can understand why she was now, and perhaps hints I missed along the way.  I was so in love with her and was planning to propose this summer.  Now she's seeing someone else, and I had no choice but to move out and crash at my parents airbnb for the time being.  

I lost the woman I loved, our two cats, and my way of life in an instant, and I've been mentally sprialing.  

I've made myself go to the gym, down about 25lbs since the Feb breakup, I'm on different medication that perhaps would have been better than what I was taking that let me get lax in the relationship. I'm drinking and smoking less.  

But I'm unhappy.  I can't enjoy movies or videogames, I go out to the bar with friends for a distraction but so often find my mind wondering what she's doing or how we used to enjoy this bar, etc. Etc.  And when we're done, I have to drive home alone.  Going to sleep isn't fun, and waking up is worse, because it feels like my brain resets and I have to remember everything the next day.

I'm certainly more mindful and aware, I keep thinking of cute little things I could have done to show affection better recently. Or just made an effort to be around more for her rather than watch football or see friends.

I didn’t really have an actual conversation with him, I filled out like 2 packets asking me what I struggle with, what my life goals are, how I am with people, stuff like that. I then did that computer test where you slap the keyboard for every letter except X which I did horribly on (I don’t know if I’m supposed to do good or bad on that but that was my genuine result) then he said “you’re good to go I’ll call you and send you your results in 2 weeks” and then I left.

What is that? Is that how it’s supposed to go? I thought he was gonna like atleast talk to me. Either way I’m not really that upset that I didn’t talk to the old man for an hour+.

My question is: what’s the likelihood I’ll finally be put back on my meds? I’ve been jumping through hoops and BS just to get an appointment to talk to someone about it for the past 6 months.

Thanks for any responses in advance!",adhd,worldsbestcowboy,2019/04/28
19408,mindfulness,"Natural altered state through emotions/mindfulness Heya! I turned to mindfulness to help me feel my emotions instead of suppressing or denying them. It's made a world of difference for me and my mental health. 

My psychologist advised me to really immerse myself into my emotions though mindfulness (i.e. the quicksand metaphor). Lately, this practice has been catapulting in me into intense altered states or body highs. For instance, connecting with my loneliness can bring about this sensation of being the only person in the world, with an incredible soothing calmness and peace. Focusing on love and desire can bring about emotional orgasm that's a LOT like the real thing without the physicalities. 

I don't try to draw out these states, and I don't go looking for them exactly, but of course they are very pleasurable (and strangely comparable to some of the drugs I did when I was younger). My main goal is to become emotionally in touch and healthy, and I'm not sure how these altered states fit in. What do you guys think?",mindfulness,participation-prize,2019/03/08
18807,mindfulness,"How to handle fears with mindfulness? I have been working trying to learn about and practice mindfulness. One thing I struggle with is when I put my brain on mindful mode, my subconscious puts my anxieties on blast. One in particular is phobia of tornadoes. I have been through two tornadoes in my life, and this season has been particularly bad for them. My home has no basement, so I have to constantly pay attention to the weather to be ready to leave my home to seek shelter if need be. When I put effort into being mindful, these worries all come to the forefront and cause me very uncomfortable anxiety, so I stop being mindful. I'm sure if it was not worries about tornadoes, my mind would find something else to obsessively worry about. My question is how do I use mindfulness to overcome obsessive worry?

4687,adhd,"Need support right now. Can anyone relate? (Long) Hey you guys. First of all, this is long, so thank you to those who take the time to read this. I hope someone out there can relate so I can feel less crazy or can offer me advice. Long story short, my behavior over the last 6 months or so has concerned me. It feels like it's gotta be something worse than ADHD. I meet other people diagnosed with ADHD that go on to get their masters degrees and live productively and I'm just like ""HOW??"". They don't seem to struggle on the level that I do. How can I be SO far on the opposite end of the ADHD spectrum where these people are not only graduating once, but twice and I can't even finish my AA certification?!? I feel as though i'm not just failing at life, I'm completely drowning in it. I put so many important things off until the last minute that I'm currently drowning in bills that have gone to debt collectors, in dozens of voicemails/emails that feel too overwhelming to open or respond to, in a 2 year old to-do list with nothing checked off, and in hundreds of other things that I'm avoiding, causing me to be an anxious wreck who constantly beats her self up through negative self-talk.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeing a therapist and I'm learning a lot about myself. I'm trying not to beat myself up so much or compare myself to others, and I'm learning new techniques and helpful skills for managing ADHD (although implementing them has been another issue)....but even though I'm seeing someone, it would just be nice to not feel so alone in what's going on in my life right now and how I've been feeling about myself and the world around me overall.. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's whats up-- I quit my job this past July. Fast-forward to now and I still have yet to create a resume, nor have I applied to any jobs in person or online. It has been FOUR FREAKIN MONTHS of me basically just sitting on my a$$, binge watching television, painting/drawing, getting high, and feeling like I don't want to leave my house or do anything at all. I had zero energy. It's a chore to even get myself to shower. That alone, or something like getting myself to do my laundry, would be a huge accomplishment for that day. Granted, during this time, I had just fled an emotionally abusive relationship, had just moved into a new apartment in a new town, had to unpack/organize/decorate, etc., and I was also not properly medicated. Maybe I should cut myself some slack because I did genuinely have a lot going on, but I can't help but feel like a piece of sh\*t for wasting the last 4 months. It reminds me of how I've basically wasted the last 10 years of my life if I'm being completely honest. It's soul crushing to feel like the things that are so simple, quick and easy for ""normal"" people to do, like printing a resume....which should take 5 mins to an hour.....is PARALYZING for me and would take me hours upon hours if not days. There is a resume storm cloud has been hanging over my head every single day for 4 months and I know it's there, I'm aware of it's looming presence at every moment. I know it's important, I know it's time sensitive and I know that I'm blowing through my savings, but it's like I don't care. I know I need to JUST DO IT, regardless of how tired or unmotivated I feel, and whether my medication is working or not, but instead I just put on my sunglasses and just pretend that everything is sunny and fine. Or, I tell myself ""tomorrow!"" every single day for 4 months, knowing damn well I won't actually do anything tomorrow, or the next day. 

&amp;#x200B;

My psychiatrist switched up my meds just a few days ago and I already feel an improvement, so I'm hoping I'll start to get a grip on my life, but I just feel like compared to other people who are 30, I've totally already f\*cked up my life and wasted so much time overall. I recently learned about the pomodoro style of planning and creating to-do lists, and I have high hopes about some of the new time-management techniques I'm learning about, but at the same time, I've gotten my hopes up \*so\* many times in the past that I don't expect much now, you know? Each and every time I go on a new medication or begin a new project I think it's going to be great and then I'm left let down and right back where I started. I'm starting to wonder if all of these years of struggling with ADHD symptoms (and feeling like they're getting worse with time, not better?) and the 10+ years of not being able to find quite the right combo of meds....I'm scared it could mean that maybe I have something worse than ADHD. I worry that I'm bipolar or borderline or something else entirely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a few things that I think about/struggle with. Does what I've written below sound like ADHD related stuff to you guys? Do I maybe just have really severe ADHD? It feels like I can't manage my life like a normal, functioning adult AT ALL, even on ADHD and anxiety meds.

&amp;#x200B;

I lie about things a lot and I often don't even realize I do it. Sometimes it's intentional, because I'm embarrassed about something. Other times I won't remember having entire conversations, and I'll tell someone a story that I've already told them, only this time, I've changed a bunch of details. I--  a) had no idea I already told them, b) don't honestly know which version of the story is correct because I don't trust my own memory, and c) don't know why I embellished the story and was unaware that I was doing it until the words were already out of my mouth. I've lost a lot of friends because of these things and I feel like it has gotten worse over time and it kind of scares me sometimes. Because of my poor short term memory, I also feel like I'm getting stupider because I feel like I can't retain anything new that I learn. I really wanted to try to go into nursing, but I quit before I even started because I know people who are smarter than me and don't have ADHD that couldn't even pass, and I think even on a high dose of meds it would be impossible for me to pass and stick it through if they couldn't even do it as neurotypicals. As far as the intentional lying goes, it's really sick behavior and it gets me into some seriously deep holes. For example, after I quit my job, I gave myself a month off to rest, but told myself that I would be applying for jobs during this time. I never did. The month was over before I knew it, and then I had to start lying to my then-boyfriend about a fake job that I got hired for when in reality I never even applied for one.  I was too embarrassed/fearful to admit that I hadn't even spent 10 mins trying, so instead, I went through all the effort of pretending that I was going to work everyday, five days a week for over a MONTH!!! I would wake up at 6 am, get dressed in business attire and then drive to a coffee shop where I'd hang out for 6-8 hrs while pretending to be at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

You'd think after all that time sitting in a coffee shop, 5 days a week for 8 hrs a day, I definitely would've sent out resumes and applied for jobs, right? Wrong!!!! No matter how many times I told myself I would, or wanted to, I couldn't get it done. All I could handle was fooling around on the computer, watching Netflix, online shopping, etc. I'd work on the resume for a few hours, but would always spend my time focused on the wrong things like researching what employers look for in a resume for 4+ hours or creating a good looking header instead of actually getting anything accomplished. My excuse for not doing anything all this time was that I was going to move 2 hours away when I dumped the guy I was seeing anyway, so it didn't make sense to apply for jobs until I moved. It's amazing the lies and excuses we tell ourselves, isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

4 months later and settled into my new town, I still haven't done sh\*t. It's almost like I don't feel a fire under my ass when I should feel one. It's almost like I don't care that I'm ruining my life or that I have nothing to show for the last 10 years of my life. I'm watching my savings account balance decrease rapidly and it's still not enough to get me to take any action. I have this same weird behavior towards everything important in life. I want a college degree, I honestly do, but I don't show it. I never finished my getting my AA because every semester I kept waiting until it was too late to sign up for classes. Each time this would happen, I'd say, ""oh well"" or ""way to go, dumbass, you wasted another semester once again. You'll probably wait too long next semester too. You're never going to graduate or be successful! You'll never have a career or be able to support yourself. No guy will ever want to marry if who can't act like a responsible adult"". I literally can't get myself to look or apply for jobs, no matter how much I want or need to. WHY CAN'T I DO THIS?!?!??? I don't know how to kick my own ass into gear and ""just do"" things because they need to be done and because I need a job and need to pay rent. I tell myself to just find ANY job for now, it doesn't have to be perfect, I can always find a better one later....and yet, I still don't do anything and act like everything around me isn't on fire when it is. I also feel like I've gotten dumber since high school and I feel like no one really likes me once they get to know me...like, I make a good first impression, but people/friends always leave once I get comfortable and act like my real self. I wonder if I lack social awareness or if I'm missing certain cues in conversations like someone with autism would. I often find that no one listens when I speak, and I often interrupt people or blurt things out seemingly uncontrollably (I think maybe because I might forget what I want to say if I wait?). I only have one friend left who hasn't totally given up on me. I don't know why the other people left, but it destroys me and I play past scenarios over and over in my mind wondering where I went wrong or what I could've done differently. If only I didn't have ADHD, anxiety, or whatever the hell makes me a shitty friend sometimes. I feel like people gave me a pass the first few times of me explaining that I was anxious/depressed and that's why I shut down, isolated myself and didn't answer your calls or texts for the last few months....but then they got tired of it and stopped trying or caring. They just saw it as an excuse. I want to be liked by everyone, and I get extremely hurt and take it very personally when someone doesn't like me, whether it's someone I've spent 5 mins with or 5 years knowing. There's definitely some major rejection issues. Because I want to be liked, I have a ton of trouble speaking up for myself and setting boundaries, fearing that if I do it'll turn people off. I always have kind of felt like I never really fit in in friend groups. Like that people tolerate me but actually think I'm really weird or have issues...or maybe they're nice to my face only. I always think people are talking about me or making fun of me. I talk too much and sometimes get weird reactions to the things I say. If I'm anxious about something, I tend to process with every single person that will listen, and I can't control it. It's like I emotionally just pour out and I always end up wishing I had just kept my mouth shut. I often fantasize about going back to the age of 18 and doing things over correctly, or getting really ill in the present day so that nothing is expected of me and I'd have an excuse for not doing anything or moving forward in life. People have said that I come off as disingenuous...sometimes I wonder if my anxiety meds have dulled my emotional response. Like...sometimes I feel that I lack empathy towards others and am emotionally numb towards what they're going through....super rude coming from someone who expects and needs their friends to be there for all of her emotional crisis.

But my ADHD brain is like a crazy hoarder house with just piles of random stuff everywhere. So when somebody asks me to fix up a snack, to most people that task would be just that: fix up a snack. But for me, before I can start thinking about the snack itself, I have to find a plate underneath a pile of clothes in the bathroom.

.........................

.........................

.........................

22F, I was followed back to uni (24 hour labs, I'd gone to cinema with a friend) at midnight about a year and a half ago - I got off the bus and went to put my headphones in as I usually do to combat general anxiety of walking home alone, and I felt a swooping feeling in my gut of ""100% do not do that. Do not do that, you will die."". I looked around and could only see a couple of people still wandering about but nothing immediately untowards, but I was still nervous so started walking but kept my wits about me. Along the walk I noticed a figure quite far behind, a couple of times I turned round and they were still there but I was trying to remain calm and logiced ""If I'm walking around, it stands to reason someone else is. They're probably just trying to get home."" ignoring the fact that each time I glanced over my shoulder the figure was closer (I'd been awake 37 hours, I wasn't in the best decision making mode).

 I was followed for about fifteen minutes and when I heard his footsteps speeding up and heard his breathing - it was at this point I realised I'd fucked up and should've called someone - I turned round, fists up ready to punch/defend myself with my keys, and he was within arms distance. He immediately stopped, ducked his head and mumbled, ""sorry going this way."" doubles BACK on himself and cuts into the trees we were walking beside. I hurry the rest of the way to uni just trying to keep breathing. I get into one of the buildings that requires card access and freak out for half an hour before calling security to escort me to the dorms where I break down on my flatmate. And then phone a friend for half an hour until I'm calm enough to fall asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried googling resources pertaining to being followed but I keep getting things about repeated stalking and tbh they just don't feel right those coping methods. Whenever I walk home now being winter, it's dark around 6/7pm and I freak out even though I now live down a different road and there are cars about (previously it was just me and the dude following me). I get it during the day sometimes too even though that's as far from the original situation as can be.

  
I keep phoning my dad at all hours whenever I'm walking anywhere because I get spooked by something and my heart starts going and I want to be sick. Breathing techniques sort of work but the queasiness and sense of foreboding/unease doesn't unlatch until I phone dad and keep him on the phone till I get home. It's gotten to the point where even if he's at work or recently a fancy dinner for work, he'll step out and answer the phone (thank you, love you). I don't want to keep interrupting his life like this. If he's unable to answer I might phone my mum, or I'll put on 80's music and speedwalk the rest of the way home. But this will leave me in a funky mood for a couple of days due to restless sleep caused by freak out on the walk home. Which in turn leaves me irritable and jumpy. I'm also more likely to jump at shadows now/jump when friends sneak up and hug me from behind (I've explained to them to please not do that they just forget sometimes).  
I still get jumpy/anxious even when walking with friends. If someone's walking down the same side of the road towards me I will get my keys ready in my hand and my heart starts going because I'm terrified they're gonna try something.

&amp;#x200B;

There's only so much logic can do - I used logic the first time round and look what happened. Therefore my brain doesn't listen to logic now even though the chances of being followed twice are low.

And there no point in talking to my parents my dad is a hot head and my mommy just say that let my know and a breath that she doesn't care.

Can't say old middle and high school friends because I never had any and I was home school. Not collage friends because i don't go to college and I can't say work because that job that I have I don't have to work around people.

And I have a hard time opening up to people and talking to people because i don't want to come off weird and awkward. Sorry if this come off all over the place its just feels like I had to get it out. I been trying to write this all day but Just didn't know what to say or how to put it.

7267,anxiety,"Panic attacks and Brain Zaps back after 2 months I have panic disorder and for about months around November and December last year I was having panic attacks and brain zaps daily and often.

Basically locking myself in my room and being absent from work. I was seeing a physiologist during this period and he told me to see a doctor and go on Zoloft after about 6 weeks of treatment without it. 

As soon as started the Zoloft the panic and brain zaps had gone away although I was still anxious but as the weeks went by I started to feel my normal self again, started back to work on Jan the 7th, although after that great first week I had small brain zaps started happening again over the weekend. I booked in with the Doctor and he told me to increase my dosage of zoloft to 75mg. 

These last two months on the 75mg have been great. I've been enjoying work, seeing my friends quite a bit and just enjoying life being much less anxious about panic/zaps (same thing really in my eyes). But the other night I had a nocturnal panic attack (full blown) that woke me up.

I went back to my doc in the morning and he gave me Ativan (Lorazepam) for whenever I need since panic attacks/zaps have been infrequent. Although he said if I have anymore over the weekend come back and see him on Monday. So today I had brain zap, only lasts 2 seconds but it makes me extremely anxious and basically what causes my panic disorder cycle. 

My Parents where crying and upset since I told them that its back again. I took .5mg of Ativan today and so far haven't felt much difference but if I go back to the doctors I bet hes going to tell me to up the dosage of Zoloft to 100mg. Should I do it or should I just take more lorzepam over the weekend until I see him on Monday? 

\-Sidenote: This is the first time I've been on ssri's and lorzepam but not the first time I've experienced panic disorder. My first experience was when I was 12 years old for about 3 months. Then a few one off panic attacks until I had panic disorder again a few years ago and then again last year. In between those periods of anxiety and panic I've been completely normal and happy.

Welcome to Old Lady” instead of Old Navy. 🤦🏼‍♀️ Sometimes by brain and mouth simply cannot process at the same speed...which has gotten me in trouble this week. 😔 I said something to someone that I should not have said...I didn’t even think about it. It came out and before my brain could make that U-turn and stop my mouth from opening, there was a massive accident on the highway of me. It’s like a six car pileup and it’s all my fault. 
I *never* meant to cause the pileup. That was *truly*, *never* my intention....but here I am: at the center of the biggest foot in mouth pileup accident I have caused in a rather long time. The worst part? It was purely meant to be a helpful nature. I meant to be helpful and still caused casualties. 😔 I am feeling like a total soggy bag of crap...which is hard to deal with because my inner speech is “you are a worthless person. You are terrible at everything you do. You cause problems, and you fail over and over.” That’s my every day inner speech. It’s terrible today. I am not looking for advice, as I have already taken the steps in getting everyone out of the pileup, but kind of needed my people, if that makes sense?

17055,lonely,"Just feeling the same again 5-6 months ago everything felt pretty hopeless, I worked a mediocre job. Had no plans for my future and was actively planning to kill myself within a few years. 

Fast forward a bit, I woke up one day and slowly but surely I kinda perked up a bit. I didn’t get happy overnight, I still wouldn’t say I’m happy. I just finally fancied the idea of bettering myself 

I started working out, very minimally and have been inconsistent for a while, I’m trying to get back into athletics and fix myself up. I’m trying to start over in a sense, while I’m still young. I’ve cut a lot of people out of my life and I’ve truly believed for the past few months that things really CAN get better if I give it time. I got a new job recently and I’m finally planning to go to college soon for a career I think I’ll really enjoy, something I thought I’d never do.

But in moments like these, I guess it just all comes back. How I’ve been for years. I dwell on every little ounce of shame I carry with me. I have no social life at all, mostly because I just haven’t tried and also because I’ve always been genuinely bad at it. Again, I feel these things can be improved genuinely if I make an effort to work on myself. But how I feel in these moments really draws away from it. I think of all my failures and mistakes and it eats at me. I feel like I’m truly a loser just masquerading as someone decent, like I’m in denial and can’t accept that I’m meant to just be alone forever. Sometimes that feels like an easier alternative, I’m not cut out for any of this but I have to suck it up and keep fighting, hoping I find what I’m looking for.

17608,lonely,"FOR THOSE WHO FEEL ALONE IN THEIR ""LOSTNESS"" I have felt alone for a really long time, which is truly amazing considering I'm living on a planet with billions of other people on it. Maybe it’s a me problem. I’ve said this before, but the same event, or the same feeling, can only occur so many times before it’s time to acknowledge that you may be the problem (and if not the problem, then maybe the causation). There are times when I’m happy. Everything seems to be working out, and I’m surrounded by one or two people that make me feel connected. They become my everything, although they don’t know it. The sad thing is that, for as much of everything as they are, they’re still, in the grand scheme of things, next to nothing. I have a theory, but I think I’ve gotten so used to leaving others behind that I don’t even LET myself get attached. Why would I? It’s always another fucking heartbreak at the end of the day, and if I can save myself that extra little bit of pain, why wouldn’t I? One huge problem is the other people though. Guys thinking they’re in love with me because they’ve never been friends with any other girl before. I know that I should be flattered when so many people have liked and continue to like me, but in all honesty, I am sick of it. You don’t know how irritating, how painful it is to have people think your friendship isn’t good enough. They always want something extra out of you; more attention, more time, more touching. Why can’t I be good enough? Why do I always have to end up being seen as some sexual object? All I’ve ever wanted was to find a group of people who could love and accept me for me. Forget my fucking body, because that’s not really me. I believe there are things that are more “you” than others. For example, your face is more “you” than your pinky toe is. As nice as that fine toe is, your face is what you’re putting out and presenting to the world everyday, whether you like it or not. My consciousness, this entity inside of me… that’s me. That’s what I want to be appreciated for. When no one is there to accept me for that, I find myself in places like this at 11 at night. So much on my mind that I need to get it out somehow, and so lonely that I’m typing it out on a fucking computer. If this is you, or this has EVER been you, understand that you are not alone in this feeling. You can feel and be lonely in many other ways, but this is not one of them. Whether that’s comforting or not I leave to you. I know it’s nice to be your own special little emo snowflake, but much like everything else, you’re not very special. You can see it that way, or you can take comfort in knowing that you’re not quite as barbaric and unlovable as you might think. Maybe you are, but maybe, just maybe, your feelings are entirely human and redemption from them awaits you. There’s simply no saying, and I certainly wouldn’t want to get your hopes up too high in the event that’s not the case. Either way, I wish you luck.",lonely,TehSpicyNoodle,2019/08/16
6545,anxiety,"My therapist thinks I want to change my life just because of anxiety. She discourages me from doing any drastical choice, but I know I can't do anything different. I'm (24m) a university student. I have three exams left, but I can't study anymore because I feel like a liar. Three years ago I was orribile with a girl that had been my girlfriend for a semester when I was 18. I was struggling with dissociation and can't figure out anything about my life (even gender and sexual orientation). In that period I was like a big dunk gorilla that couldn't understand human beings, just psychological violence worked with me. I had only one friend that made me do things that I regret (not too bad things, but things that not fit with my personality at all). The girl was so disgusted by me and called me hipocritical (because in a discussion jumped out that I coudn't really understand what I read, and I'm studying literature). I remember that I couldn't even understand the meaning of that word, because my vocabulary was like reduced to minimal. 

Now, 3.5 years later, I feel better, but I can't stop thinking about that orribile moment of my life. I think that if I had chosen another subject of study I wouldn't ever had this experience, and I can't stop questioning about my real self, if I like or not the subject that I study. I can't go out or say anithing.

I can't open a university book without being hit by intrusive thought, but I spent the last two years closed in my room reading a lot trying to be the right person to study literature when I feel good, and just avoiding all watching videogames videos on YouTube (and I've never been really into playing games, it's just relaxing) when I'm in bad mood.

Now I just want to start a new life and be an authentic person, changing university and town. My parents always want me to study Biology and maybe I will. I feel just unsure because I can't really know what I like or what I do not like.

19328,mindfulness,"Staying present in the difficult moments I discovered the world of mindfulness and meditation about 10 years ago and it's had a profound impact on me as a human being. 

However, I still have my moments. When I picture the best version of me it would be someone who stays calm and positive when things go wrong. But that's usually not how it happens.

For instance, the other night I was about to head to a concert to see what I refer to as a ""bucket-list"" band. I was so excited. I got in my car and whatya know, it doesn't start. I immediately go into woe is me mode. I'm living paycheck to paycheck so I really couldn't afford to take an Uber and I didn't know how I was going to pay to get my car fixed. I ended up taking the Uber anyway and I was feeling sorry for myself the whole car ride and thinking some very negative and self defeating thoughts. 

So anyway, the concert was amazing and I figured out a way to pay for the car repair. And here we are two days later and life is good. This is almost always how it happens. Things work out fine, and life moves on. But it's so difficult to see that when you're in the moment.

The diagnosis makes a lot of sense, and answers a lot of questions about why I’ve struggled with certain aspects of my life. However it’s also opened a can of worms. It was never mentioned as a possibility before; I got told I had anxiety and some ASD symptoms but my GP refused to refer me as he felt I was functioning. Again, long story. I was never identified in school, just got told that I “talked too fast”, “didn’t sit still”, “your lazy” and “you’re not doing your best”. I developed a lot of mental health problems in my teenage years, and as an adult I’m struggling with debt, anxiety and depression. I’ve been in several relationships and always end up dumped because I’m difficult, and I didn’t have a real friend until I was an adult.

All my life have been having depression and anger issues. And the past few months it has been getting from bad to worse. I  find that I will snap at the slight irritation. Super bad habit is that I would tend to jump to conclusions even at some minor bad incidents. Example, when baby doesn't wanna sleep at night, I would snap and pace around with all possible bad scenarios in my head fearingthat I will hv to have years of sleepless nights or fearing for my baby bla bla bla etc. 

Question is how to accept and let go of my current reality, ie accepting what is happening right now and not let it get to my head.

I mentioned a few things like communication and interpersonal skills but then bleeding thought came into my head about a teacher who was part of my college who was recently mixed up with a sex scandal and a student. It was very big moose and the entirety of my college were talking about it. for some reason I said that some people really aren't cut out for teaching and shouldn't be allowed to and I decided to give them the example of this female teacher. I didn't go into massive detail I simply only said that a teacher who also went to my college who was a year older than me was mixed up in the sex scandal and it's despicable. they tried to ask me more questions like what's going to happen to her now and is she still a teacher but I decided best to deflect them.

Now I'm almost forty with one long distance friend that I hardly ever talk to and a cheating boyfriend that makes me feel like shit. He likes to throw it in my face how he's the only one that's ever been there for me and no one cares about me. He has a huge family and lots of friends. I'm pretty sure he's embarrassed by me.  

Once I get rid of the boyfriend I wont have anyone. Yes I have my kids and I love them more than anything but they barely speak to me. I always try talking to them but they're getting older and have a lot going on and that's ok.

 I'm so tired of bending over backwards for everyone else, trying to gain their approval. 

I recently started working after many years. I was stressed about being awkward around new ppl and having them judge me. But then I realized no one can make me feel worse so fuck it. I don't care anymore. I've wasted my whole life feeling worthless because no one cared about me. So I really don't care anymore. Not caring was like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. 

I am who I am and I accept me the way I am.

And the funny thing is now ppl want to talk to me and invite me out but I think it's too late. All this misery has helped me to explore who I am and I'm grateful for that. This is the only life I know and I'm used to it. I think I actually enjoy it",lonely,junkaccount0690,2019/08/20

I grow increasingly more bitter and hopeless every fucking day. I can't keep living like this. People weren't meant to be alone this long. I know it's stupid. I know being totally undesired by women shouldn't make me borderline suicidal, but it's starting to.

If I had a gun near me last night I would have used it on myself. I joined a discord call with a friend of mine to play some games. He's never struggled with girls before. They flock to him, he's never even had to ask a girl out. He had one he met from his work over. I got to listen to it all. Their cute conversations. About how they were going to cuddle that night. I left the call without saying a word and cried myself to sleep.

I can't keep going like this. I've lost track of how many times I've been rejected in person before. I think it's around 30 or so. Most were nice about it at least, but I've had some brutal ones as well. In high school I asked a girl I liked to prom and all she said was ""eww"".

I swear to God the moment her friend saw me she turned to said to my roommates girlfriend. ""You really must hate me"". 

I don't wanna be labeled an incel. I don't hate women, but I hate the way they've treated me. I've seen they way they treat good looking guys. The light in their eyes, their flirtatious behavior. Then they interact with me and that all goes away in an instant. It's absolutely soul crushing. I don't know what else to do anymore. Dating sites obviously don't work. Neither do bars. I need more social hobbies but at this point I work so much I wouldn't know how I would manage. I don't want to believe it's too late for me, but it totally is.

Yes, if some disease has already developed, then there’s no other choice but to take medicine. So similarly, once a person develops a strong negative emotion, like anger or jealousy, it is very difficult to counter it at that moment. So the best thing is to cultivate your mind through practice so that you can learn to prevent it from arising in the first place. For example, the major source of anger is frustration and dissatisfaction. At the moment when an emotion like anger is full-blown, even if we try to use our experience and our knowledge to reduce it, we will find it is very difficult to stop. At that point it is like a flood. During monsoon season, it is too late to stop the flooding. We need to start early in the spring and investigate what is causing the flooding and try to build flood walls to prevent disaster.”

4646,adhd,"I'm worried that I might be slightly addicted/too dependent on my meds I was diagnosed with ADHD 7 years ago, and I've been taking Focalin for the last 6 years. My typical dose is 30mg XR in the morning and 15mg IR in the late afternoon. However, my doctor prescribes me 30mg XR and 20mg IR per day so I can have some flexibility based on my workload for any particular day. When I was first diagnosed, I did a lot of research on stimulants to understand how they work. I know they work like a bell curve where just the right amount of medication helps you focus, and any more or less than that doesn't work as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, on days where I feel extra unfocused or didn't get enough sleep, I always think that more meds = more focus. I also just \*like\* the way medication makes me feel. Much too often, I find myself taking an extra 5-10mg when I don't really need it. Sometimes it helps, but the majority of the time it just makes me fidgety and anxious, and it doesn't even help me focus more! I don't even LIKE that feeling, yet I continue to do this because there is this little part inside my brain tells me ""I want more.""

I know it could be a lot worse. I don't crush up my pills and snort them or take exorbitant amounts, I never run out of meds too early, and I take breaks all the time. But still, there is this little voice in my head that wants to:

**a)** take them even if I don't have anything to do that day and just am going to chill on the couch, or

**b)** take that extra 5-10mg that I know I truly don't need

18982,mindfulness,"Anyone else have to overcome breathing problems to meditate? I cannot get past the fact that all guided meditation draws such attention to my lungs filling with air. Hi all,

So I have tried guided meditation a lot, but there’s one thing that really gets in my own way - and that’s the beginning of meditation sessions when the person is telling me to “breathe in, and breath out” or “feel your chest fill with air” or something similar.

Before I continue - I have successfully managed to meditate a handful of times in my life and it’s bliss. Once when I was floating in the ocean in a rubber ring listening to the waves, and a couple of times when I have been very tired and tapped into the sounds around me (almost more like on the verge of napping)

So, it’s not like the successful times I have meditated I have ever been to do with the way I breathe. I don’t ever think about air expanding in my lungs, so as soon as I’m told to draw attention to my breathe I immediately get a tight chest and almost reminded of my delicate squishy lungs. I sort of get annoyed at these sections and just want to skip the breathing stuff.
I just want to breathe in my own way and not be told how long I need to hold the air in my lungs - as sometimes I’ve already “breathed out” before the person on the tape has told me to breathe out (or I haven’t finished taking in a nice deep breath and they are already saying breath out) 

This really throws me off!

Can anyone recommend any good guided meditations (or other practices’) that don’t focus on this lung filling aspect? Or in anyone’s experience, is this something that you struggled with too, and what did you do about it?

I would love nothing more than to meditate like this - I have tried over and over again but I feel like I’m some sort of freak and I’ll never be able to meditate because of it. 

Would really appreciate your experiences!

4223,adhd,"My professional future is a perfect storm of stuff I can't do very well I've worked most of my life at typical wage-slave jobs (sandwich shops, retail stores, call centers), however over the past three years I've managed to land (and keep!) an actual salaried position at a large and well-known tech company.

Disregarding the fact that this is the longest I've ever held down a job, I also managed to work myself into a position that requires a lot of the skills at which ADHD folks kinda... suck.

Granted, I literally carved this position out for myself and while I'm getting all the support I need from my superiors and peers, I'm definitely nervous about how this will all turn out.

My new projects/responsibilities consist of:

1. Time management
 * Write up a concrete project plan, with estimated timelines for how long each part will take to complete, using self-set deadlines
 * Clearly lay out what I will be doing at each step
2. Self-organization
 * Collate and organize large amounts of disparate and dispersed information into easy-to-digest, concise articles
 * Set up lines of communication from multiple teams direct to myself, so that I can easily update and add to those articles
 * Stay on top of my other duties while juggling all this
3. Constant availability
 * As-immediately-as-possible respond to and address any issue escalated to the team I'm on, at any hour (as long as I'm awake), no matter what I was in the middle of
4. Self-Motivation
 * All these goals and deadlines are set by myself, often far in the future, and at each stage there is nothing immediate that's pushing me to do all this.
5. Communication
 * Translate information provided by devs/engineers into layperson's terms and vice-versa
 * Act as a line of communication between a number of different teams in different contexts and ensure that information moves quickly and accurately.
6. Completion
 * I gotta actually complete all of these tasks and not just do 75%-90% then lose interest and stop.

Anyway, not really a 'looking-for-advice' post, but I figured maybe some of you folks can relate.

I've been managing my symptoms really well for the past two years, which is how I ended up in this situation in the first place; no one would have thought placing this kind of responsibility on me was a good idea, before.

I have my next appt with my psychiatrist coming up, and I don't know if I should ask for a higher dose or ask to change to a different stimulant such as Ritalin.

4439,adhd,"ADHD and visual learning (Disclaimer:  never been diagnosed, but had epiphany after niece diagnosed.)

&amp;#x200B;

I've noticed in work (software engineering, previously a non-engineer in a STEM field) that I feel like I'm a visual learner.

&amp;#x200B;

The primary way this manifests itself is that if someone is explaining something to me, it goes a lot better if they draw lots of diagrams or make short notations on a whiteboard.  Deep discussion---\_especially\_ on issues I'm not familiar with---without a visual medium like a whiteboard or piece of paper often leaves me confused.

&amp;#x200B;

I do think I have a more visual brain.  That being said, I don't think it's the primary reason for why I need whiteboarding, really like to be able to look things up on the 'net or in books.  I think the primary reason is that, following a simplistic model of ADHD, if someone is just blabbing at me, I can't remember it all for later playback, nor fully process it in real time.

&amp;#x200B;

Previously I've summarized this as ""not being able to think on my feet,"" though wasn't really sure I was like this, or merely lacked confidence.   (I definitely have comorbid anxiety and am very negative about everything.)  Now I think I know what's going on, though.

While it does sound relaxing, it also sounds terrifying. 
A lot of my anxiety stems from my religious upbringing. I will not go into detail, but it is because of the rapture for those who may understand. Panic attacks are almost instantaneous if I can't get a hold of anyone (my husband, mom, dad, sis, etc). It is not as bad as it used to be, but this particular anxiousness has reared it's ugly head again. So being in a dark, quiet room with no access to the outside terrifies me. 
I want to try and do this floating thing because I am under a lot of stress and could use some relaxation (in my last semester of college). At the same time, I don't want to force myself to do it just because it was a gift. I know that I can't let this defeat me every time, but it is so hard to face it.

4575,adhd,"How to cope? I (m15) went to see a psychiatrist a few days ago. I believed that I really needed to get meds, because therapy simply wasn’t working. Over the last few months, my mental health was declining. I wasn’t going to school, and I just felt like absolute shit. I was scared initially, because my therapist told me a few stories about medication and how dangerous and addicting it is. I later realised he didn’t send me to seek medication just so he could get a few dollars out of my pocket. 

When I went to the psychiatrist, she asked me and my mom a few standard questions. Up until that point, I thought that my lack of motivation was the result of my depression, nothing more, nothing less. That’s until she had us fill out an ADHD questionnaire, which got me confused. She told me I most likely had ADHD.

I didn’t know that I could have had ADHD. I mean, aren’t I supposed to be extremely hyper and fidgety? But then she told me about the different types, and listed the possible symptoms. That’s when it hit me. All the times I was distracted or bored in class, all the times I couldn’t finish school work. It made sense. 

I was happy that it was that and that I wasn’t just a lazy piece of shit. They prescribed me Ritalin and it felt fucking great. I was happy for once that things were going right. 

Then I realised. I don’t understand, how my father didn’t have it, my mother didn’t have it, my little sister doesn’t have it, and yet I’m the lucky one that had to get ADHD. How do you cope with that? That bad luck gave you ADHD for the rest of your life? That if I don’t take a small pill every day I’m going to stop learning? I’m not particularly attractive.

4919,adhd,"I can't see the point of anything in life anymore, because of my ad(h)d. Hi everyone,

this will be a long post so I don't expect you to read it all but maybe someone can help me out if they experienced the same thing. Also my English is not perfect.

So basically I have ADD since when I was a kid and it has caused a lot of trouble in my life. I'm currently 17 yo and almost depressed. Sometimes I just want to end it all ofcourse.

My trouble started when I was around age 13, when I first noticed I couldn't finish school by doing nothing. In the past I could just get away with doing nothing because I could just make tests and everything with common sense or knowledge that I already had. But then my grades became worse and worse, untill I came at a point I had to do the third year of school again. The year proceeded and i failed again only 2 months in. That was when my mother and I (father left the household) decided I should take medication (methylphenidate).

That is when things started to get bad. I was feeling horrible all the time and people were saying I was a different person. And meanwhile my mother would scream at me for every little mistake i made. She always used to scream so I naturally wanted to please her. I felt really bad because of my medication and i wanted to quit, but my mother would shame me and get angry everytime I even mentioned stopping with taking the medication. So the second time I did the third year of school, I DID proceed, and I kept taking my medication until it was half way in the forth year. I got so tired and depressed from these pills that at one day I just decided to quit. 

Ofcourse my mother was furious but this time I didn't give in. I stopped going to school and ended up sitting at home for maybe a month. Then i went to a new place wich was not a school. This place was specially designed for people who can't do well at school, like me. My mother resisted this at first but knew this would be better then letting me sit at home all day. So i went to this place (I'll call it paradise school), with the only condition that i would go back to school after one year.

I accepted this because I was really desperate and that was actually a really good decision. I absolutely loved my time there because it was a totally care free and worry free environment. The place was basically a huge terrain with a lot of trees plants water and small buildings. In these buildings you could hang out, make music, read, paint or basically anything that you asked for. I never felt better in my life then in this place (not in a way when your gaming or eating junkfood, but genuinly good) . But then, eventually, the year came to an end and i needed to go back to school. 

At first I was optimistic to return to school, but man, that went away really quickly. I couldn't concentrate just like before and all the problems from my past showed up again. This is where I'm at currently in my life. I'm going to school but i can't do anything and I really mean this. I just can't focus for longer then 5 seconds. And ofcourse this makes me really sad and depressed. I feel so bad and i can't talk about this with anybody, since my mom gets angry and nobody else cares about this. I've considered ending it all many times, but I know there has to be another way.

 I know going back to the ""paradise school"" where I only have to focus on the things that I want, doesn't get me a good future. I won't have any certificate or any diploma and people will not hire me when I'm going to look for a job. On the other hand I can't stay in school and if I do, it will probably result in a burn-out. 

Can somebody PLEASE relate to this, or give me any advice when it comes to leaving school or not?

Thanks a lot.",adhd,CraziestManInRussia,2019/01/29
17514,lonely,"I don’t necessarily feel lonely, rather I feel like I’m missing something I was on my route to school this morning when I remembered that I had thought of something funny the other day. I couldn’t remember who I was with, but I knew that I had some amusing idea. After a moment of pondering I realized that I hadn’t been with anyone at the time, I was merely thinking to myself of that funny joke or whatever it had been. I had remember a time spent in my own head as if I had been with someone. And I feel like a lot of people could relate to this?

I’m so used to being alone that I’ve made company of myself I guess. The realization honestly made me a bit happy. I wish I had friends, and I know at my age it isn’t necessarily good to have no friends, but I also feel sorta lucky that I’m not dependent on others for my happiness.

I’m 14, and since I don’t go to regular public schools I’m never in situations where I can actually put myself out there and try to interact with people my age. Even at my work the people are in their twenties.

I used to have a lot of friends, and I went through a very quick shift into seclusion so I feel like I’m always kind of missing something? That’s kinda what I associate with loneliness. That feeling of knowing that something else could be there I guess to fill that strange gap. Sometimes I just wish I had somebody that I could care for and just hang out with. 

But then it comes back to the piece of not being in situations where I can meet people, and I feel a little strange about meeting people online.

It is like a slight version of autism and i don't like being that way. It all started during my diagnostication when i was 5. Everything was fine until i git devastated that i had asperger's and i was tormented for it. I felt lonely and i always felt ashamed of myself and who i am, i tried accepting it, but a group would not stop tormenting me. I have suffered through a lot including 3 car crashes, a dislocated pelvis. Salmonella,and frostbite resulting in a brain paralisis at birth. And i am forced to be in a group of people that i hate due to me not having the same ideas or just are straight up crazy. And thay have an ENOURMOUS ego. Which it made me different and they would always tease me no matter what, like ""oh ur lame cuz u watch anime"". And i have always been affected by people lowering or completely destroying my self-steem and the only trustworthy friends are the ones that are trwated the same way, one has multiple personality disoder and is a little bit distant and blah blah blah. I am a little bit better but i still have to be in that first group i mentioned because they are my cousins and i am treated like crap at school for being 'annoying' but i just let it slide until people harassed at school and being sent a lot of kys messages and it keeps getting worse gradually each time i ignore. And i always try to be a normal person. But get rejected anyway of any activity.

I hope you all are well. Maybe it's just the holidays, but the way I eat has been weighing on my mind much more recently. Eating, and the balance I keep with exercise, is a huge part of me staying emotionally healthy throughout the winter. That said, I'm struggling a bit as it's my go-to option for stress, happiness, sadness, etc.

Has anyone found an app that's helped them be more mindful about their eating and their impulses to eat? I'm not looking for a calorie tracker, I'd like just something really simple that lets me take a few notes on what I eat and how I'm feeling or what I'm doing while I eat.

4960,adhd,"Cigarettes For a few years I casually and socially smoked (mostly when drunk). Rarely purchased my own cigarettes, never felt any addictive pull for them. Sadly, after a year of increased anxiety and struggling to find professional mental health support, I would say I’m nearing addiction. I feel like ADHD plays a huge role in this. Need to fidget? Have a smoke! All over the place and need to calm down? Cigarette time! 

The most surprising factor was how it helps me concentrate on my surroundings and conversations. It just centres me in a way that I never achieved with mindfulness. I really really don’t want to rely on a gross habit to feel this control.

It was my 3 month med apt. I have been wanting to stop my meds (Adderall xr 20mg a day) for a while now because it kills my sex drive and messes with my mood. I hinted before to the doctor that maybe I should take a break and he insisted I continue. Maybe I should have explained better. Anyways I have a voicemail from them and I'm at the point now where I feel foolish and embarrassed to even call back. My excuse is valid but the fact that it's been a week and I've just put it off I have no excuse for that. What do I do? At the new year my visits and meds will go back to full price which I can't really afford ($130 visits and $200 a month meds) because of my deductible.

I didn't give it much thought because I didn't really know anything about adhd. But finding this sub was a complete eye opener. 

So now my next step (which requires a level of self care that I just don't possess) is to get an evaluation. It's taken me months, but today I finally reached out. I sent a short message to this doctor's contact page. I gave my age, sex and explained that I'm not sure what I have, but from the little I know,  I might have ADHD and I would like to get tested. 

This is part of her reply:
""To diagnose ADD, we need written records from either Psychiatry/psych tests/ pediatrics/school/report cards/parent note showing onset before age 12. 
FYI only 2% of persons who are “diagnosed” w adult ADHD actually have ADHD, According to American Journal of Psychiatry. There is almost always a different disorder responsible for their symptoms. Unless someone has childhood records, I almost never prescribe stimulants.""
Am I overreacting, or is this lady giving me the junkie brush off? If I had records and psych evaluations and a written history, I'd probably be asking for treatment not testing. It was so hard to take this step and then to be treated like a drug grubbing low life that doesn't rate anything beyond a template screening response...

&amp;#x200B;

I started talking to myself. I quit rambling on and fantasizing about what-ifs, what could be-s; it was all BS anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I ask myself. I started out with smoking cigarettes. I asked myself, ""Do you like this?""

&amp;#x200B;

I felt/heard a quiet answer, ""No."".

&amp;#x200B;

""Would you like it if I quit?""

....""Yes.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Should I clean my house?""

...""Yes.""

""Do I want to?""

...""No.""

""Should I?""

....""Yes.""

""Why?""

................

""Will it make me happy?""

...""Yes.""

&amp;#x200B;

As I kept exercising this part of my brain, with simple ""yes"" or ""no"" type questions, I began to actually hear a non self-destructive inference. This inference, or feeling/voice, seems to be right. I notice that when I listen to it, my life is better.

4352,adhd,"My RSD might be impacting my marriage? Hi,

So my husband will sometimes remind me to do something that I have forgotten, or let me know when I forgot something, or question my logic when I do things that don't make sense to him, or get frustrated when I forget things. None of this is unusual and he never does it in any way that could be interpreted as a personal criticism, it's simply him making me aware.

But it reignites all the times I've second guessed myself or criticized myself for similar or even the same things that he's bringing to my attention. And I go into this loop of just feeling AWFUL about myself and how I'm going to end up ruining my marriage because I just can't stop doing all of these stupid little annoying things. Occasionally they turn into full-blown panic attacks, which I'm careful to work out in private, away from him, because I consciously know it's not his fault, and I refuse to guilt him for airing perfectly valid... Complaints is a strong word, but complaints. 

It's to the point now where I, I'm ashamed to admit, find myself avoiding him or dreading talking to him, in fear that he'll say something to set off these episodes. I'm not sure what to do. 

I know many of you are going to say I should talk to him about it, but I NEED him to feel comfortable telling me when I do things that affect him. I know that if I could never tell someone when they did something wrong for fear of setting them off, that could get to be really difficult to bear, and I might even end up resenting them.

Took my first meds this morning. 
30mg elvanse.
I don’t feel good. 
ADHD kind of felt like they were clearing  up 45 mins after taking. Begin to feel funny in arms, legs and stomach.  Like I’m on recreational drugs and close to peaking.  2 hours in and I’m a t work and can’t do work properly. Can’t focus attention to read emails. Feel jittery like I’ve rattled gallons of coffee. 

It’s almost 7 hours since I took the pill. I’ve left work and am in the back garden. I don’t feel like my adhd symptoms have cleared up. They feel more pronounced. Still got the jitters and the occasional slight euphoria. Jaw is clenching but I’m very conscious of it and am focusing constantly on it but it’s more like a secondary task that my brain is working on. Like I’m not thinking about doing I’m just doing and my first thoughts are on typing this. 

So my questions are:

Did you have these issues on first taking the pill?
Did they pass and how long did it take?
Was it a sign that you needed a higher dose?
Was it a sign that the drug wasn’t for you?


P.s I am also aware that I am out my tits on amphetamines. 🥺🥴

P.p.s I’m quite light in weight. Only 55kg. 5ft5 tall.  Could this be a factor? 

Thank you in advance. Life has been very wild for me up until the last few months and I’m hoping that this is the beginning of me taking control.

&amp;#x200B;

This study is being conducted as part of my (Guy Fincham) MSc research project in the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of St Andrews (Ethics approval code: PS14205). We invite you to participate in a research project examining how different types and durations of mindfulness meditation practice affect well-being. Participants should be 18+ years of age, living in the UK, and fluent in English. People currently experiencing low mood, any active mental health crises, untreated mental conditions or recent major adverse life events are advised not to participate in the study, as mindfulness meditation could increase the psychological distress.  


The study includes four groups. Two will complete one type of meditation practice central to mindfulness- based cognitive therapy (MBCT) but for two different durations (one shorter, one longer). The other two groups will complete another type of core MBCT meditation practice for two different durations (one shorter, one longer). All the meditations will be led and guided by Professor Mark Williams, co-founder of MBCT and Founding Director of the Oxford Mindfulness Centre. All groups will be asked to practice daily for two weeks. All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires about well-being and any barriers or facilitators to practicing over the two weeks. Please be aware that participants are randomly allocated to the groups. Two of these will require participants to engage in movement (simple stretching). If you are interested in participating but have a physical condition, please consult your GP or physiotherapist beforehand.  


The study will be online and information you provide will be anonymous and held confidentially by the researcher and supervisor involved in this project. Individuals who are interested in participating can follow the sign-up link above. Here you can review additional information about the study, provided by a Participant Information Sheet, to let you decide whether you want to participate in it.

Hi, this is my first post here and I am not sure if it breaks the rules, I am sorry if it does but I wasn't sure where else I could ask? Basically, in my adult assessment for ADHD a year ago, I flat out lied about my drug use (said I had never touched anything except a very small amount of weed) because I knew that I needed ADHD meds and was worried they would not give that to me (I was diagnosed when I was 13, now 20 but not considered for medication due to other health complications at the time of diagnosis). After struggling for so long, I knew that this was the best path for me. At the time, I was recreationally using a drug on almost a weekly basis because I had pretty much given up on hope for my degree and decided to have fun in my last few months... since then I have obviously realised that I can do it, but I just need some more support. In the year since, I have used a handful of times, only on birthdays or if offered at a particularly boring party, and I would really like to open up to my new therapist about the drugs I was using last year and how it has impacted me now. However, since the drug I was using is a stimulant and known to be dangerous with vyvanse (what I am prescribed), I am worried that as a result of lying about my use in my original assessment will mean my therapist will have to alert my doctor due to the somewhat unsafe circumstances of my orginal prescription. My therapist is not the same therapist as the one who assessed me for ADHD (the NHS doesn't really offer that much in therapy for adult ADHD as far as I know, and I am now doing CBT for other issues), but I am worried she will be obligated to tell someone that I lied in the first place and therefore could still be in danger if I am using regularly with my Vyvanse. Does anyone know what my best option is here? I really feel that telling my therapist about my drug use a year ago is important because of its impact on me now, but all my doctors records show me saying that I have never touched drugs. I really can not afford to lose my Vyvanse, it has changed my life and I finally feel like I have the ability to act like a somewhat competent person for the first time in my life. If anyone has any advice, please help me out :)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I lied about my recreational drug use in my ADHD medication assessment as I thought it would prevent me getting the prescription I needed (which has now drastically improved my life), it has now been a year and I hardly use at all anymore and want to open up to my (non-ADHD related) therapist about my drug use in the past but am worried I will lose my meds due to the implications of the previous lies and the dangers of combining Vyvanse with other drugs.",adhd,spidermanns,2019/06/14

1. Her manic episode will most likely end in 3 to 5 months (It's been 6 months so far)
2. When that happens there will be a big problem

It was really obvious that she only broke up with me because of the disorder. So she will most likely regret the decision once the mania is over. But that's not all. Bipolar people are known for destroying their own lifes while being manic, and in her past manic episode she did a lot of stupid shit. I think there is a pretty big chance of her completely destroying her life. I'm not sure what she will get into, but I would not be surprised if she comes out of the episode with a huge debt, HIV, traumatic experiences like rape or other things that will destroy her life. 

So right now I can't focus on anything at all. No minute goes by without me thinking about her and the deadline in a few months. I don't have contact with her currently. I don't know any of her friends. I can't do anything. I can just wait, until the manic episode is over.

I’ve made some friends living here, but not enough for them to know my birthday and for someone to want to make plans with/for me. I don’t wanna just randomly ask people to take a day and spend it with me because it’s my birthday, because the embarrassing and sad idea that they’ll say they’re busy or just can’t when I’m basically begging anyone to hangout with me for my birthday is enough to make me not reach out.

I know I could “treat myself” but being alone and doing that just sounds even more sad. I know this is a stupid reality most everyone probably lives with eventually, spending birthdays not being appreciated besides the texts from close friends and family; I just wish society didn’t make birthdays such a big deal to the point I start feeling less than for not having a cool 20’s party with friends and a big social group and making me feel like shit when I already hate being the center of attention anyways.

6592,anxiety,"I can't physically function alone without my pets My entire life I have always felt like something is watching me and following me around all the time, especially in the dark. I have always been consumed by sheer, paralyzing terror any time I am somewhere alone (meaning without other people or animals around), mostly at night/in the dark, but sometimes in the daytime too, and even inside of my own house or in the office that I work at. The first panic attack from being alone that I can remember happened when I was between 8-9 years old.

I feel like a prisoner in my house at night because I can't even walk into another room without asking one of my animals to come with me (although they're always happy to). They eat dinner together in the kitchen every night and I cannot physically make myself leave the kitchen until they are done, because if I walk around inside my house when they are out of my sight, I get this weird unexplainable feeling as if I am being watched/followed and about to be brutally assaulted. I can't walk past a dark doorway without my heart racing and my hair standing on end. I can't turn a light off in my house unless I can see one of my animals nearby. If I go outside to get something out of my car or make a trip somewhere at night, I have to take my dog with me, because even being inside my car alone in the dark can trigger a panic attack. I can't stay late at work alone either. The only major trauma I've had in my life was when my boyfriend of 3 years committed suicide, but I've never been assaulted or had any reason I can think of to be this paranoid, and as I get older I feel more ridiculous about it. I have no idea why I'm like this, my parents always told me I would grow out of it but I'm 23 and it's as bad as ever, just wondering if there's a name for it? Is this more common than I think it is?

I think it’s important for us all to realize that meditation and mindfulness is a journey that doesn’t end (unless you believe in Nirvana, which is fine). This means that we should be more receptive to others ideas, because with that knowledge we can then realize that we’ve never “fully” learned what mindfulness or meditation is. There is always more to learn, and I feel that we should always be willing to help others when they ask questions. Meditation is not just one thing, and neither is mindfulness.

I graduate this December wooo. It’s ridiculous bc I have a 3.0, managed to keep that way for the past 3-4 semesters. Now for most people I’m assuming, that’s decent right, enough to graduate. but heck, I’m planning on getting into med school. It’s a result of realizing MD is truly what I wanna do for my self too late. now that low GPA has been haunting me since.

one might say “it’s okay, you can still bring it up”. yea, I agree. I definitely agree and I wish I can remind myself that everyday. It’s gonna be hard but it is possible even though I’m taking extra difficult classes. Even though I know it’s possible, I’m scared and anxious my gpa stays the same, or worse, goes down to a 2.something. If that happens, there’s no way I’m getting into med school soon.   

But that’s how anxiety works right, can’t really think straight bc I’m scared and now I have no bone in my body that is excited to graduate. This semester is like a deep, deep lake that I’m too scared to even dip my toes in.

TL;DR I ran out of my medication (Vyvanse 40mg). I tried to contact my psychiatrist's office, they did not respond to the two messages and refill forms I've sent. Vyvanse works on Dopamine and Norepinephrine production, so I've gotten B6 and Panax Ginseng in hopes that it helps to combat the dip in my brain chemistry. I am all ears to your stories and advice about times you've had to abruptly stop taking your prescribed stimulant medications. 

After trying to contact my Psychiatrist multiple times with no success, I am stuck now without my prescribed medication. I can't decide whether this is an emergency or not. Either way, I am not sure how to get help. So far I've been focused on foods that could help balance my dopamine and norepinephrine (so hard to spell jeez) levels. I also exercise everyday. I hope this community has solid access to meds they are prescribed; I do too, but I waited until I had three capsules to seek a refill. To be fair, refills are supposed to be processed within 24 to 48 hours at my institution...its been 72hours. And I've left multiple voicemails on their ""general mailbox"".

I work from 8am to 5pm, and I ran out of meds today. I grabbed a Vitamin B6 supplement and some Panax Ginseng to help me fight the dip in brain chemistry. I am active, so this dose help a bit, and overall my day wasn't too bad. Results may vary, but I highly recommend B vitamin supplements on or off meds. I might get some caffeine, but I have to start slow on this because of my low tolerance; I didn't drink caffeine while on Vyvanse.

Another plus is that my heart rate has been lower on average. My mind has definitely started to wander again, but the supplements do help a bit.

I recently have started a job as a server. I wanted to be more outgoing and “overcome” my fear and anxiety with rude and mean people by becoming a server, where I have to deal with these type of people everyday.

This has gone fine, and since I’m super nice not many customers have been rude to me. I have always gotten them to understand any problems I have serving them, etc.

But I have this one coworker that, to her, I can’t do anything right with. Every time I mess up or have a problem (or even an honest question) she talks down to me and makes me feel stupid, using that condescending voice where she emphasizes every word. Sometimes she will talk to other people about me too. It also doesn’t help that she is just naturally a very outgoing and confident person, which is something I’ve always wanted to be. 

I know to any normal person they would just get over it, or just say “fuck her, I’m fine” and let it go. But it makes me want to cry in the bathroom every time I have to work with her. It has ruined anyI confidence I have and really has worsened my self esteem even more. It’s gotten to the point where I am actually embarrassed of myself there and every time I inconvenience someone I have to hold back tears.

(Buspirone/Anxiolotics) I was recently prescribed Buspirone to treat my anxiety, and while I did have some minor side effects for the first couple of days (lightheadedness, sensitivity to sound) those effects have since disappeared and I've been doing pretty well since then.

I have however noticed I've been experiencing some sort of brain malfunction in oddly specific situations, and I'm trying to figure out if anyone else has experienced something similar:

For the past few days, whenever I've been watching a movie or playing a game and a scene where two or more characters with *vaguely* similar yet still distinct voices are talking to each other, *and* they're facing away from the camera so I can't see their mouths, I've been finding it really difficult to distinguish between the characters and follow their conversations. (I told you it was specific.) 

As one of several examples, I've been playing Red Dead Redemption 2 recently, and there are many parts of the game that involve riding a horse alongside your gang while discussing whatever mission you're about to undertake while the camera trails behind them. The only similarities between each character's voice is their accents, but there have been multiple times where I've had to restart a checkpoint because I've been so confused as to who's talking that I haven't been able to follow the conversation properly.

I've never experienced this before I started buspirone, and I haven't been experiencing any other cognitive slips in any other situations as far as I can tell, but for whatever reason this weirdly specific malfunction keeps happening to me

The reaction to me telling people is like a superhero villain- I reveal I’m exploring a diagnosis and people seem to want to start a fight through passive aggressive suggestions how I can’t possibly be right and I’m just ‘dramatic’.

4904,adhd,"What am I supposed to feel when on meds? I don't know if this is a stupid question but I've got an appointment with my doctor on Thursday and I'm asking to go back on medication. I was only diagnosed earlier this year and trialled two different medications. The first was Concerta (very low dosage to begin with, I think 18mg) and I think we went up to 36mg. I didn't feel any different. I think at first I thought I could concentrate more but then after getting lost in this thought I realised I'd left my train tickets in the machine (lol) so I figured maybe placebo effect. I was getting more stuff done than usual though so didn't get as much overwhelm.

I told my doctor I didn't feel anything so he recommended something stronger (vyanse, can't remember the dosage) and it was horrible. I felt like I was on a very mild ecstasy. I was gurning a lot and just wanted to smoke all day because that was the only thing that felt nice. I didn't even finish the medication with that one because I hated it so much. Couldn't get anything done and didn't want to leave the house in case people thought I was high or something. I guess the closest thing I could describe it as was when you're on comedown from ecstasy but still get that feeling of the night before. 

What the hell am I meant to actually feel? Thinking about it now, I think concerta might have been better because I didn't actually feel any different other than being able to face the day a bit more. Can people that are on what they believe to be the right medication explain how they feel on it?  ",adhd,cerahhh,2018/12/10
19141,mindfulness,"Director at a Start Up Looking for Ideas to Promote Mental Health/Mindfulness Title pretty much says it all. I am in management at a start up. I don't have a very large budget, but we are headed into our busy season. My employees work so hard, but I want to make sure they're taking care of themselves. My questions are: 

- What are things I could do that would promote good mental health &amp; mindfulness during our busy time? 

- Have you had jobs that focused on your mental well-being? What worked and what didn't? 

- Mental health is a personal subject. What are the lines that you feel like shouldn't be crossed? 

- With a limited budget (truly like $100) and little room to give extra people time off (above my pay grade, unfortunately), how do I keep my wonderful employees from feeling burnt out?

4536,adhd,"Get Diagnosed - But Don't Ever Accept Deadline Extensions as an Accommodation for ADHD From my own experience. You have to get diagnosed or you'll just feel like you're being thrown around by a system which doesn't understand you.

But you do have to be responsible for your ADHD. I.e. I thought that it would be a good idea to get extensions for things because I have days where I can't seem to focus on anything. But, despite the pain of having to pull an all-nighter because I did nothing all day, I actually got worse grades when I started asking for extensions because it took away one of the few tools that I had to get things done: adrenaline.

It also took the burden of the responsibility off of my shoulders and placed it onto someone else. Which, just doesn't fly in the real world of people with jobs anyways, especially not in the U.S.

You NEED to be challenged if you have ADHD, not cared for. Being cared for literally makes the ADHD like 10x worse because without pressure and a sense of duty you will literally not do fucking anything responsible.

You need to take steps every day to make yourself a little bit stronger. I wish I knew this when I as a child - but no, my dad just took very little responsibility in terms of disciplining me, and my mother, while she took on more of that responsibility was very busy and would always roll back her punishments.

And that is part of why I have such a massive student debt load and why my actual ADHD didn't get diagnosed until adulthood. Get diagnosed, and focus on making yourself STRONGER, not looking for every person to ""get it"" because most of them won't and you're also just not ""getting"" them because they also have their own shit to deal with.

As soon as ADHD becomes someone else's responsibility, you're fucked. That mistake cost me a good 50-70,000 dollars, and the net total of what I've missed out on if I could download my current knowledge into 10 year old me would be something like 300,000 to 1 million dollars from lost scholarships, taking on private student loan debt, not getting as good of a job from lack of GPA and likewise having no money to invest with.

4609,adhd,"idk what to do with my life/school anymore. oof tl;dr: I got fired at my interhsip probaly because they found out i have ADD now i have a overwheliming amout of homework and have no idea how to ever get my life back togahter. 

&amp;#x200B;

this will be a long ride sorry for the grammer mistakes i am also disletic

&amp;#x200B;

I have ADD and i am in the second yaer of college in social care, that means i work in all kinds of health care from mental health, addictions too elderly care.

so in the begginng in the yaer i had a intership, it was a bit of a challenge. a day care of those with early onset dementia this is a bit of a diffecult work field as these poeple are around the age of my parents and have a lot of behaviour problemns becuae of thier illnes. lets say it went okay.

I had a lot of issues focusing in the morning we all sat toghater with all 25 clients to talk about thier weekend about the news about thier struggels ect. i found it really hard to talk with this since it just overwerlmed me i was not sure when to speak and when it was my time to talk. No one ever said anything about this so i just assumed it was fine. i mean they gave me compliments about other things i did. 

so like after   a week of 6 it was time that my teacher come over for a meeting with the people who watch me at my intership. i only got bad feedback.. what i did worng how this wasnt my thing... shit that was painfull .but we decide i was going to work on it! i was going to the social worker at school who would help me with my confidece and stuff. i was going to make this work!

halfway the meeting i told them i had ADD had not told them before. my co worker allready assumed this. 

aftter my teacher left they said something like ""next time you get a job you should tell them about your disorder beforehand so they know what thier dealing with. since you know having this isnt a thing you can have when you work with this kind of poeple""i was shook. its ADD  i can still work. ( they also thought i wasnt able to read since i was dislectic lmao idk what thier thinking) 

&amp;#x200B;

anyway next week i wrote down my plan and went back to intership, they even explaind me new stuff that morning(how to work with the weekplanner) so i was pretty postive. until my co worker asked me to come to thier office and  sit down with her. long story short i was fired because she thought i woulnt make any proggres. she did also say that it might be better if i get a differnt kind of job like offfice work so i woulnt have to be social. Woman i am social i am just insecure! and add with a office job hell no!

they did mention i could come back to talk about it. great.

and it was the day before a break so i had no way to contact my teacher. ( who they promiised to call if anything was worng) 

So after the week of and I imformed my teachter they where all shocked and mailled my old intership. Since i didnt feel like comming back and talk aigan they stopped my contract fully and i didnt have to go back.

my teacher mailled them for me about what i told what happend. and they sadi i lied! i did not lie! i felt so hurt i was so worried i all made this up or hallucinated it idk. (no clue why i was worried about that last thing since i dont hallucinate lol)

but because of all this drama i had to go a level down go to a differnt class and find a new intership. 

&amp;#x200B;

I luckely have a new place now and it goes way better here but i am so badly behind. for you intership you have to do 5 big assigments and i have done none of them. (deadline is in 5 days) since well i wasnt able to work on them for weeks. and you have to work on them at your intership.

&amp;#x200B;

In the mean time that i have to work extra hard to get all my assigments and examns done. But i also have to work on other things. wich normaly allready take me longer then the most classmates sicne i can not fcking focus. 

So here i am with a lot of work no clue what do do first or how to ever finish this all. I am really bad in social stuff so i am kind of to scared to ask for help at my intership. 

i go to the school social worker and school conselur but i still feel like i am never getting this togahter. esspecily now my whole projectgroup decide to not do anything so i have to do even MORE extra work.

&amp;#x200B;

i have so much work at this point that i just get so overwhelmed and lay in bed crying, i can not fouces and write one paragraf a day. i really really try but i just dont seem to fix it. i just get mad at myself all the time.... I really wished i didnt have ADD i feel like my life would have been so much better.

19100,mindfulness,"The invisible self The outside world is a visible reflection of the invisible processes that defines a being. What defines a being comes from the invisible side of things, and what a being ultimately seeks is the one who is doing the definitions. It is only when the being will focus its attention upon the invisible within itself, that the being will nourish the one who is doing the definitions. Otherwise, the being only nourishes the definitions themselves, and thus gets caught up into their temporal states, rather than remaining one with it’s natural and eternal state as that which remains forever invisible.

To nourish the invisible side of ourselves is to nourish the eternal side of ourselves, for the invisible side is always present wherever and whenever we are. When we nourish the visible side of ourselves, we feed that which is temporal, not eternal. To do so constantly within a repeating pattern, generates mental vortices which sucks the attention of the being within temporal manifestations of itself, thereby placing the attention of the being upon that which will forever remain unstable. Those temporal manifestations are manifestations in the visible domain, of the constant interactions that exists between the visible and the invisible, in the macro and micro perspectives of the universe. Those interactions generates movement which is a direct manifestation of change for nothing visible can remain the same forever - the visible being forever modified by the invisible!!!

The same relationship is true in the human side of things as well, for it is true that for a human being, the constant interactions between the visible/sensed and the invisible/unsensed domains, generates the movement which is responsible for the experience of life itself. The constant cycle going from one state (invisible/unsensed) to the other (visible/sensed) and back into the one state (invisible/unsensed) again - repeat ad infinitum -, will generate the movement that is responsible for the vibrations of light/energy itself. For the goal of light/energy is to return to it’s invisible/unsensed state, to which it does cyclically at the rate of the plank unit of time, or at the smallest possible unit of time. At each time it returns to it’s invisible/unsensed state, light/energy releases the light/energy that it carried while on the visible/sensed state, into the invisible/unsensed domain. Through the release of that light/energy within the “invisible/unsensed domain”, that light/energy instantly dissapears from our 3d space-time continuum, and enters the realm of the invisible/unsensed continuum, so as to “pick” the information found within that realm and bring it back to the visible/sensed continuum. 

Within the invisible realm, the light/energy gets impregnated with wathever information that is to be found at that specific moment within it. The light/energy returns to the visible/sensed domain - after the smallest possible unit of time possible, known as the plank time -, fully charged with what it has brought back from the invisible/unsensed domain. The light/energy releases that charge instantly within the visible/sensed domain, thus releasing the total expressions of the total impressions it has brought back from the invisible/unsensed domain. The invisible/unsensed domain imprints the light/energy with content/information that will be released within the visible/sensed domain at the next plank unit of time, or at the next “flash of light/energy” within the visible/sensed domain. Each time the light/energy flashes it’s contents/informations - coming from the invisible/unsensed domain - within the visible/sensed domain, the visible/sensed domain is updated. After this moment, the light/energy returns back into the invisible/unsensed domain in order to generate the next generation/iteration of the visible/sensed domain for the being to experience. This process is never ending but to resume, the visible/sensed domain is the space where the imprints received from the invisible/unsensed domain, carried within light/energy, are released, while the invisible/unsensed domain is the space where the packets of light/energy are imprinted and charged by the contents/informations found within the invisible/unsensed domain.

The visible is made true when we perceive ourselves through the senses, which doesn’t specifically equate to our sight. Our senses gives us specific information about specific wavelengts of the light/energy. Those specific wavelengths of the light/energy, gives specific information to those specific areas of the brain which can detect those specific wavelength of the light/energy. For some areas of the brain, those differenciated wavelengths are detected as sight. For others, they are detected as sound, as smell, as taste or as touch. The common denominator within them all, is that they are all different interpretations of the same light/energy. A light/energy which exists, forever in a constant relationship with the invisible.

It is at the moment where the invisible meets the visible side of things, that the present is made true. The Now is the constant manifestation of this process throughout eternity. It is only in the Now that the invisible side of things comes into direct contact with the visible side of things, for it is only in the forever changing Now, that the invisible is made true.

What a being seeks, is to reunite itself with the invisible side of things, for the eternal being EXISTS within the invisible side of things, not the visible. This is demonstrated through the simple fact that the one who is doing the thinking remains forever invisible - the “visible being”, being only temporal manifestations of the “invisible being”. The invisible, in and as itself, can never be demonstrated, for as soon as it is, it’s essence changes into something new. Every new other things will forever come and replace every demonstrations of the invisible as a thing, thus rendering every demonstrations of the invisible as a thing to be forever false witnesses of the invisible as no thing.

The only true witness of the invisible is the invisible itself in action. And that invisible is the subjective side of a being.

To seek ourselves into the visible, is to seek the source of ourselves within what we are not. We are not the visible, for the visible is a temporal manifestation of the intemporal being that we seek, and is thus not the being that we are. That being is the eternal being of which we are truly and forever one with - we are forever one with it for we are forever one with the invisible side of things -, for we are the invisible being which forever processes the visible into something new. The being that we seek exists as the invisible side of a being, and the invisible side exists as the inner subjectivity of a being. However, the paradox is that the invisible side of a being is and cannot be limited or expressed through words for what it truly is, and therefore, cannot truly be expressed through words, for as soon as it is, it loses it’s attribute of invisibility, thus it loses it’s true nature/meaning as it is expressed. A word or a series of words can only point into the direction where the invisible exists within a being, but can never portray what the invisible is in and of itself.

We process the visible through us constantly changing it within the invisible side of ourselves. For it is within our invisible side that the processes of evolution, or the processes of change through transformations, occurs. These transformations are absolutely necessary, for the invisible is absolutely necessary, and for the invisible to be forever true, change has to be forever true. If change was somewhere, somewhat not true, then it wouldn’t even be possible to entertain any ideas upon existence. We wouldn’t exist. The only way for this absolute necessity to be true, is for the visible to change constantly through a process of evolution/”equilateral additions” that operates in the visible and invisible side of things. Everything changes constantly, but only at different rates. The invisible is the space within a being where the visible transforms itself into something new. It is the invisible space where the invisible creator as ourselves, modify the visible universe by transforming it so as to change, evolve and create the ever changing visible universe that we experience.",mindfulness,OuroborosLife,2019/08/02

 One thing that was super beneficial for me was taking my focus off of  the anxiety, emotions, and thoughts I was experiencing, and then moving  my focus to my functioning. I stopped tracking how much anxiety I was  experiencing each day and started to focus on the actions and things I  was doing with my life. For me these were things like focusing  on being engaged with clients at work instead of ruminating, living in  the moment, and putting my time and energy into things that would take  my life in the direction I wanted to go. 

 I slowly took all the time I was spending on ""solving"" my anxiety and  OCD issues and put it toward something else that I actually valued. This  was so beneficial because it allowed me to experience anxiety and all  the other emotions without reacting to them. I simply allowed myself to  experience those emotions while doing what mattered to me, and this is  ultimately what led to my recovery.",anxiety,BuildingBrainWaves,2018/12/27

I was always kinda anxious-ish as a kid, particularly when it came to my death phobia... I refused to go on a class trip to the museum because there were mummies, I was traumatized by children's adventure movies like huckleberry finn because I hated seeing the skeletons/human remains, cried at 5 years old when I was told I too would die someday.

It all simmered down more or less as I got into my teens then twenties - and I was otherwise 'normal' albeit  a little shy/vigilant for a couple decades... then it all came to a head when I found a guy my age (late 20s) deceased in a public bathroom from natural causes - panic attacks, hypochondriac tendencies, googling heart attack symptoms and generally much more on edge. 

Luckily things have gradually improved with a few hiccups... panic attacks are very few and far between, I've gotten gradually more relaxed about being in a saveable situation should something arise, but I'm still not back to 100%.

The other day I saw I had 4 days off so I decided fuck it, I'll book a last minute trip to budapest! A few days later and here I am, at a bar as I type, drinking local craft beer after being to the outdoor hot spring pools with public changing areas, various restaurants, making small talk, and staying at a hotel - all by myself.

- **For starting your day fresh**: Inhale through the nose for 6 seconds and fully exhale through the mouth for 3 seconds.
- **To relieve stress and quickly relax and unwind**: This technique is called box-breathing where you inhale through the nose for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale through the mouth for 4 seconds and then hold for 4 seconds.
- **For sleeping quickly**: This is one of the most useful techniques which I use to calm my mind at night before going to bed. Inhale through the nose for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds and then exhale through the mouth for 8 seconds.

All the exercises can be repeated 4-5 times if you're just starting out and slowly increase the repetitions once you become more experienced. I also made [an app](https://theunwindapp.com) to help with these breathing exercises if you'd like to check it out.

Like many here with ADHD, there are patterns in my relationships that show signs of underdevelopment and immaturity. I've been taking a lot of time recently to sit with my thoughts and understand how to better improve my relationships with others.

The specific issue I'm working on is that my level of focus, patience, &amp; friendliness goes down the longer that I know somebody. The first example I can remember is with my parents, who have told me in the past that I appear much kinder to others than I do to them - almost like I cut myself more slack when interacting with them knowing that I won't receive judgment.

They're absolutely right. 

From my observation, I put up my best 'I don't have ADHD' mask when meeting new people and I'm more likely to nod to show I'm listening, smile during conversation, and give them as much of my attention as I can. Then when these relationships transition into long term friendships I have a tendency to allow myself more and more to lose focus, get distracted, and give less effort.

18801,mindfulness,"New to mindfulness meditation, struggling after initial amazing success, please help After hearing about mindfulness and meditation a lot but not wanting to get into it because of the spiritual BS, I finally really gave it a try one morning inspired by [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAVPDYhW_nw) It was amazing and I didn't want to stop. I felt relaxed, I was enjoying everything, I was more aware of what I felt about different things (I am normally somewhat emotionally numb), I was more aware of physical sensations and sights and sounds and smells and taste and mouth feel - it was WONDERFUL. I felt really good and I kept it up pretty well for about half an hour, I think, with residual effects throughout the day and even some now several days later. But I have not been able to do it again.

&amp;#x200B;

I was fairly relaxed that morning already. The past several days though I've been pretty anxious and just cannot get my mind to shut up. Trying to quiet it turns into it going ""BE QUIET!"" at itself. And instead of approaching that wonderful state of awareness, which is like a different mental mode, trying to quiet my mind becomes more of a scary shutdown-thought-and-sensation feeling. I did start getting close to the mindfulness state earlier, but only had it for maybe half a second, if I even reached it. There's been several times when I feel like I'm getting close and I suddenly get super excited and all thrown off as my normal mind state goes bonkers and is like ""OH BOY WE'RE ABOUT TO BE HAPPY AGAIN!"".

&amp;#x200B;

I can remember when I achieved the mindfulness state that I was not simply trying to delete unwanted thoughts, but becoming aware of them, sort of looking at them and then dismissing them. I really want to do that again but I haven't been able to figure out how. I was also very aware of the impulses I had to do things, and that was part of my in-road to the mental state, but since then I've had fewer such impulses or when I have had them any attempt to look at them like before feels more like trying to lift an impossibly giant boulder. It's like that mental muscle has totally given out, which is scary and doesn't make sense. I want to have that mental state back badly. Please help me.",mindfulness,TheRedMezek,2019/07/19

I recently started having daily panic attacks. I have had them before but now they are constant. This has me thinking and over thinking.

Backstory: I have been told that growing up (as early as age 3) I was a worrier. As soon as my younger brother came home from the hospital I worried over him constantly-and not worry that would be ""normal"" for a 3 year old new big sister.
I remember worrying and feeling guilty throughout my childhood. For things mostly outside of my control. 
I was diagnosed with Asthma at about 5 or 6 and as an adult I am wondering if this was possibly misdiagnosed.  The tightening of the chest with an asthma attack seems very similar to that with anxiety.

Of course, there is no going back in time to change this.  Just curious on thoughts about this and possible similar experiences. I have discussed with doctors but they seem to brush it off since we are working on my anxiety.

I am a 19 year old girl that feels extremely lonely and suicidal. I have a lot of so called “friends” and gets a lot of attention from men. I do a lot of modeling too. 
I often get told that I am beautiful and sadly that seems to be the only thing people and especially men see in me: beauty.
No one wants to listen to what I have to say, things I am passionate about and no one appreciates the knowledge I have in certain areas/subjects. I am a piece of meat. Seems like I am not worth anything more than that. 

Whenever I meet a guy he disappears after the sex even though I make him wait for up to like 6 months. I, myself feel like I am a good catch as I got the looks, intelligence, emphatic/caring personality and even humor but then why does no guy want to get to know me?
Every night I cry myself to sleep in a pile of text messages from horny men that just wants my body, every time I go clubbing I experience sexual harrasment to a scary amount, every time I try to make genuine friends I fail.
I live in a dysfunctional family where violence and alcoholism is common so I crave a lot of genuine love since I can’t get it at home.

My self worth has dropped to it’s end, I am losing hope and have been thinking about suicide for years now but I don’t think I can hold on any longer.

I am surrounded by so many people every day that praises me yet I am extremely lonely and depressed inside. No one sees my demons.

I just wanted to have this off my chest since I can’t tell anyone. Also I’d like to make a point clear for every girl out there that must be jealous of the “popular girl”: Popularity and beauty is not EVERYTHING, it’s overrated and it definitely doesn’t bring you genuine happiness but only a temporarily ego boost.

19549,mindfulness,"Morning (secular) prayers to help stay mindful throughout the day? Time and time again I find myself remembering old 'resolutions' that, at the time, seemed profound enough to elicit some lasting dedication to a 'new way'.  A kind of turn-my-life-around attitude.  Inevitably, as time goes on, I forget that resolution.

I think a large part of forgetting it is simply not being able to distill or articulate it into a succinct, direct message in the first place, but rather just groping at some vague notion of how I'm going to be different.

It seems most religions have some kind of morning prayer type ritual to remind them to be studious, industrious, kind, etc.  However, I am not religious and don't plan on becoming religious.  I don't think that means I should miss out on the valuable dedications, though.

Does anyone have one they'd like to share? Perhaps a resource for such things?

My current one is actually just a few lines from the song ""Show Me"" by Big Wild:


*Don't let me show ugliness

though I know that I can hate...

keep me away from apathy 

while I am still awake*


I like these lines because they acknowledge that I have these things, hatred and apathy, within me, but it also recognizes my control. Having a few lines on hand actually seems to help me be more aware, and catch these undesirable feelings before they consume me. I feel a bit of transcendence over these negative forces when I repeat the lines to myself, and it's helped me stay more centered since about a week ago when I started doing it.

16737,lonely,"Had a great night, hate myself for it I wanted to post this in r/foreveralone but don't have the comment karma to be able to post.
I went away last weekend for an old friend's birthday and went for a night out. For some context I'm 21 and have never had a serious relationship although for the last couple of years I've become ""content"" with being solo. Anyway I was out with a big group of friends and most of us took mdma and went clubbing. It's something I've done before but I generally avoid it because my comedowns are really brutal. Anyway there was a girl there who I've been friends with for a few years but she's had a boyfriend for most of the time I've known her, and she recently got with another guy. So I didn't expect anything to come of it, nor did I want anything to. But as soon as we got to the club she wouldn't leave me alone, and kept holding my hands to dance with me and hug me. It was the closest I've been with anyone for years and it fucked me up.

I know it was just the effects of the drugs but it was so intense it's just ruined me. We danced together for hours just staring at each other and kissing each other, not ont he lips. I was blown away by how beautiful she was and she kept saying the same to me. I really wanted to kiss her but I couldn't do it and I'm almost glad I didn't. Anyway this continues for most of the night and everyone there thought something was happening between us. The next day hits and I felt awful. Awful for thinking that she'd actually be interested in me without the drugs and awful for feeling like I'd taken advantage of her. I spoke to my friends about it and they all basically told me to calm my shit and that I'd done nothing wrong but It's still ruining me. I've been talking to her on and off and she's brought up that she's having a party at hers in a few weeks but I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if her boyfriend will be there and if he is It'd kill me. I've never met the guy but I've heard he's a really decent dude and I think it'd fuck me up even more.

I get that it's cliche but I genuinely had come to terms with the idea that I'd never meet anyone, and whilst this experience likely won't lead to anything it still gave me a taste of something that seems too far away to reach.

I've had a nearly-daily discipline of meditation for the past 7 years and I really think it would benefit not only myself to become even more disciplined but to make a career out of it and help others in need. 

Aside from going to India or Asia and getting formal training from an actual guru (I don't want to leave my girlfriend for months at a time if I don't have to), does anyone have any recommendations for where to begin? There isn't an ""authoritative institution"" that hands out licenses or anything of the sort. I am well versed in the experience of meditation but I'm not all that savvy when it comes to the terms, different techniques, etc. But that's what I want to learn. I would likely do some neuro-study to supplement formal training but I don't have any college experience so getting a PhD is out of the realm of possibility for now. 

I'm currently at a point where I meditate for at least ten minutes every morning, sometimes I can get up to 20-30 minutes but I've recently been moving and commuting 6+ hours a week for the last few months so my practice has been less consistent than usual. However, starting in the beginning of August I'm going to begin reading The Mind Illuminated again and start working up the stages. So I'll have that under my belt as well.

17266,lonely,"I feel so disconnected from people I'm a very private person. Very private. There are huge aspects of my personality that I hide from friends, family, everyone. Things that I do almost everyday and affect me everyday that people have no clue about.  If I died I'm not sure there would even be a record of it somewhere. Some of these things I consider to be embarrassing/shameful (although nothing actually bad), but some are rather innocuous like my music taste or my favorite tv shows and movies. If it wasn't for my mom who knows a lot about me (by virtue of being my mom) and talks to people about me, there wouldn't really be anyone who knows me. Even my mom knowing me well sometimes feels uncomfortable.  

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it's no surprise that I feel like I do not have strong connections to other people. But I also do not want to give up my private life. I like being alone. I like living in my head. I like that people do not know me. But at the same time I find it very lonely. I've tried to balance this in the past, but I've ended up revealing too much and later regretting it. It is also difficult to make friends. I can easily get to a friendly stage with people. Enough that they might call me their friend, but since they know almost nothing about me I hesitate to call them mine. A deeper connection, I've never had. Writing it out, it seems so self-inflicted, but I can't stress enough how uncomfortable it makes me when people know private details about me. 

&amp;#x200B;

In some ways this has gotten a bit better. I'm growing very close to my best friend. But this may be because I've moved countries this past year, so I have a lot more time away from him. Absence makes the heart grow fond? I also visited him last week and told him some things about my family situation and that didn't go badly at all. He seemed a bit surprised though. In other ways they've gotten worse. I'm struggling to make friends here, the kind to hang out with when bored. All my friends back home were people I knew for like 2 years before I even became friends with them, so I don't know how I'm gonna get past that here. I hesitate to mention this, cause I feel like it colors people's view of me, but I'm a trans man. I'm going stealth here (no one knows that I'm trans) and while I do love it, it just adds another layer of distance between me and other people. All my old friends know I'm trans, cause they knew me before I even realized I was trans. It's also something I'm very insecure about, so I don't know if I'll ever really tell anyone.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is all friendship stuff. I don't even know how I'm gonna go about dating. I really don't think it will work for me. Spending too much time with one person irritates me and I end up resenting them. I'd have to date someone who understood my need for a lot of alone time or that they also had the same need. I just don't think there are many people like that. I feel like if I was born a man I would just have a lot of one night stands, but I can't even do that. I also really want to be a father, but the thought of co-parenting and having to compromise on the way I raise my child does not appeal to me. I doubt I'll ever have a child because of this. It just seems that I am doomed to a lonely existence because of my nature. I'm still young, so I may change. For now though, my social prospects are a little depressing.",lonely,fatsdynamo,2019/06/06

Three weeks ago, my boyfriend had to stay home from work. He was overworked and it hurt me seeing him like that.

Bright wildflowers with toxic leaves

You cannot tell which head belongs to which black neck
They are vultures and buzzards
Feeding off of tasks not yet completed
Ideas show their colors
My world is a melting pot of grays
Take topics like grains of sand
And hope you hold the same rock
And that the ocean has not blown the pieces across the world
To places you say you will one day visit
To view art that is trapped in a glass pane
You are given a feather to break

7278,anxiety,"Getting out of bed when you feel sick from Anxiety? Hey guys.. I'm sorry if this is stupid and I feel like it kind of is but I struggle with this sometimes and today was one of those days. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every since I was young (like elementary but really revved up freshman year of high school) my stomach gets upset when I'm anxious. I do not throw up, and it really doesn't feel like I am going to throw up, but it definitely feels bad. And, it feels similar enough to throwing up that it took me a few years to realize the signs of it being different. I don't know if this is important or not but I have never actually thrown up because of anxiety, unless I was having a panic attack, and that the stomach aches are not panic attacks. Like I have panic attacks sometimes but this is different. The amount of stomach pain directly relates to how anxious I am.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes it's really hard for me to will myself to get out of bed if I'm having one of those days, specifically if I don't have something I need to do at a certain time. For instance, Monday-Friday I wake up for work. I have no issues getting up then even if I don't feel good. But then we get days like today... I didn't get out of bed until 4 in the afternoon, and that was only because I physically could not get myself to sleep anymore and my dad asked me if I was going to get up/if I was okay. I've been really overwhelmed with school, work, and general life lately. I know that's where my anxiety is coming from and I'm working to do everything I have to do to make it better but it's going to be overwhelming for 2 more weeks. It's also worth noting that when my alarm went off at 11, I had 9 hours of sleep. So it's not that I wasn't giving myself enough sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also after things like this happen I get really upset with myself because I am aware it is my way of running from my problems but I just can't get myself to get up, and this makes me feel angry with myself. I don't feel like I should have problems with this.  I feel like this is a recent issue with not being able to will myself to get up. If I had to guess, I would say it's been happening on/off for about a year. Also if it matters, I am about to be 19 (my birthday is March 10th). 

I'm sorry if I'm rambling, I read through the post and I feel like I am but I'm having trouble identifying what isn't needed. Thanks for anybody willing to help me. 

Tl;dr: Sometimes I wake up with a stomach ache because of anxiety, and when it's really bad and I don't have any time-dependent engagements,  I Struggle to make myself get out of bed at a reasonable time.

Hello fellow space cadets!

So I started bartending at a new place recently and they’re a great team, I love it there. It’s also temporarily my sole source of income.

Which is why I’m so wound up to the point of crying after making a big mistake last night.

Manager walked me through the bar closing protocol twice, this was my first time doing it alone. AND I was so mistakenly confident I didn’t take my meds that night, figured it was a slow night and all the extra time to double check would compensate.

Well, in my hyper focus to get the cash drop sums perfect (plus all the other things) I didn’t double check the back door was locked properly.

WORSE THOUGH: I completely forgot the part of the walkthrough where my manager showed me where to drop the keys after locking up. 

So I set the alarm and left the residential building door UNLOCKED.

Plus a couple small lights on.

Anyway after finding out my mistake and swinging by to apologize profusely to the owner in person, I still have a job. 

My manager is being super understanding about my ADHD. Told me not to beat myself up over it.

Which somehow makes it worse.

A part of me acknowledges this was a rookie mistake and won’t likely happen ever again. That I should learn from the experience and move on.

The Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria part of me is anxiously crying whenever I think about it.

I’m due for my shift in 3 hours and I’m burning with anticipatory shame. I know it’ll make me shaky and likely to make minor mistakes throughout my shift.

 It's been a little over a month since then. This week, my head started getting way to foggy around 2pm. I'm pushing through, but it's taking tremendous effort and I'm all over the place. My shrink upped the dosage from 30mgs to 40mgs.   


 At 30mg, I still had try to focus. But now I'm back all over the place, I'm not looking forward to a week of anxiety again, but I am looking forward to getting back on my routine.

I am also trying to talk, be pleasant and sell to the customers in front which is a lot of emotional labor. I am also filling up a loan file during this time, and reading and writing emails and remembering and calling customers for follow up. There is also 1 or two operational work that needs to be done on the computer. I am also signing paperwork for a fellow colleague, or trying to solve their problems, scanning. All these have to be juggled within a 15-20 minute time frame. I also only get 15 minutes for lunch and that too if there are no customers in front of me.

I am boring now, I seclude myself and I hyper-focus on just school work for hours. Time goes by way too fast now, I look at my watch at 8 am and 10minutes in my mind is 4 hours later. I have made sure to eat better, sleep at least 8-9 hours and stay hydrated. Nothing helps. I tried lowering my dose and its low enough to not make it as bad, however it makes me annoyed easily and waste time even more. I have also tried upping my dose and it is causing sleep issues for days now, I am close to just giving up on this medication.

I have better focus at times but at the cost of everything I enjoyed, my hobbies, my passions and my emotions and close friends. All I do everyday is hyper-focus on my physics and maths home work that shouldn't even take an hour, it takes me hours to do basic formulas I am extremely depressed and angry that its not working. I don't know if anyone has had any issues like this but its becoming unbearable, I dont want to tell my psychiatrist because I am afraid he will make me quit all medication and ill be failing my classes again like I was years before.

5177,adhd,"""Gradually, then suddenly."" That's how improvement looks. For someone who went through almost **two decades** without proper evaluation and treatment, I must confess I was being unrealistic and unreasonable in evaluating my progress with treatment after **MONTHS**, especially because I was on and off meds because of insurance and financial problems. But really, I've been taking actual steps in life with a future in mind. Sure, I still have problems getting on time for work, but now I have plans. I've been receiving a lot of praise from coworkers and my boss literally told me *""I have nothing bad to say about your work, except about your problem with arriving on time. But I feel like we sometimes have to 'restrain' you so you don't go beyond what is required!""*

&amp;#x200B;

Actually it's not a big deal, it's kind of a dead-end job, but hearing praise from coworkers such as ""wow, Dinosaur\_Supervisor, you really made the difference here"" or ""Thanks for making this shift easier for me, it was chaotic but if it was not for you I don't know what I would have done"", DUDE, THAT is what actually matter to me, that's what actually makes me proud of how I'm *getting better*. 

&amp;#x200B;

**And for the first time in my life I can see myself with a positive outlook** without thinking ""you're a fraud; they actually don't have any idea how your performance is terrible most of the time"". 

&amp;#x200B;

But anyway, I have a plan, I'm capitalizing on this job and will try avoid getting fired for as long as I can so I can sustain myself and invest my free time on learning other valuable skills and eventually leave. It's been 6 years but whatever, what matters is how I'm going to act **from now on**. 

I already cut several things that made me waste my time. I was basically throwing my time in the garbage can, everyday. I've been distancing myself from people who kept me in this cycle of pessimism and self-pity. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've learned that **discipline and (self) motivation are not going to magically emerge** because I'm on meds. It just doesn't happen, specially after over 10 years of sustaining a behavior similar to that of a dog: unconscious of it's own existence, its future and its place in the world. But the meds definitely help with the reinforcing of the new, goal directed behaviors. Again, it's not magical, it's not overnight. **STRUGGLE IS PART OF THE PROCESS AS IT IS FOR EVERYONE.**

ACCEPT STRUGGLE. 

ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THOUGHTS OF GIVING UP WILL EVENTUALLY EMERGE FROM THE DEPTHS OF YOUR MIND. 

CHAOS WILL INVADE YOUR LIFE AND STANDING UP TO IT WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER. 

YOU ARE GOING TO FAIL SOME TESTS. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE BAD DAYS, BAD WEEKS. HELL, EVEN BAD MONTHS. 

**Practice self-reflection:** SHIT IS HAPPENING. Is it because of something I'm doing (or not doing)? How can I manage it? What can I do? 

Sometimes it's just random noise of life.

4828,adhd,"My ADHD journey. Finally being treated, more terrified than ever. So, I will preface this by saying that I, like many with this disorder, went through the majority of my life unaware that I had a medical disorder of any kind.  I just sort of thought this was how life was, and it was tough.  I didn't present with hyperactivity as a child, but my older brother did.  So, while he got tested and for a time treated for ADHD, I was never given a second thought.  I struggled my way through school with all the common issues that I'm sure many of you sympathize with.  Never did my homework, but aced the tests, so I got by.  Bounced around majors in college and missed lots of class, wrote papers at the last possible moment, and somehow BS'd my way to a degree. 

As an adult, in my professional life, I have been a job hopper.  I average about 2-3 years before I absorb all there is to absorb about what I find interesting in the position and then get completely uninterested.  In my home life, I have always struggled to be a good spouse when it comes to co-managing schedules and completing household chores.  It's not that I don't know those things need to be done and how to do them.  I just don't do them.  There was never any reason behind it, and it really made me feel bad that I was letting my family down.

About a year ago, I laid out a lot of my symptoms about the lack of focus, trouble at home, etc. to a new PCP.  His diagnosis at the time was mild depression or seasonal effective disorder, and he prescribed me Lexapro.  Now, I absolutely hated how that made me feel.  It was like it took the brain fog and lack of focus to a whole new level.  I felt like a zombie and I stopped taking it.  Cut to this year, a month ago actually, and I am seeing a new PCP.  I law out my symptoms to him and let him know about the LexaFail.  And I basically say ""Am I just a stressed out 35 y/o man with a full time job and 3 kids and this is just how I should feel?"".  And he said ""No, this is not normal.""  And let me tell you, it was kind of great just to get some validation.  He suggested the possibility of ADHD which I had honestly never considered and didn't even know affected adults.   After a psychologist referral, the diagnosis was confirmed and I started on 20mg daily Adderall last week.

While it's comforting to finally know what is going on with me and have a plan in place to confront it, it's also a bit overwhelming.  The medication has been great so far.  Like many others have described, it was very much like putting on glasses.  I function like I should without even having to dedicate any conscious thought to it.  While I am now more optimistic about the future, I am also uncertain b/c I don't want to always be reliant on these meds.

The other part of all of this that is terrifying for me is that through learning all of this about myself, it has become very apparent that my oldest daughter, who is 6, definitely shows many symptoms of ADHD.  So now, while beginning my journey to understand and treat my own disorder, I am trying to also understand it for her and find ways in which I can help her without medication because I just don't think this type of medication is right for a developing child.

Thank you to all who post and lurk here, this community has been a fantastic resource as I have learned about this major thing in my life that has always been a part of me whether I knew it or now.

TL;DR:  Recently diagnosed at 35 years old.  Meds have been a revelation.  Uncertain about future for me and daughter also with ADHD.",adhd,austinography,2019/03/28

Hi friends! I just found this subreddit and figure I could spew my thoughts here! 

&amp;#x200B;

So recently my college has been cracking down on ADHD tests because they offer the screening here. Many people who dont need the help are basically going and attempting to get medication to help with studying.

Ill tell you about myself, I have has all the symptoms that everyone talks about since elementary school; I used to get placed in empty offices by myself with someone to help me focus. My family doesn't believe in many mental illnesses including ADHD. I have gone throughout my life just acting like the symptoms arent there and that I will eventually get over them. I am 18 and they havent gone away. I am an honor student but thats mostly due to my mother forcing me to focus etc. I am in my third year of college and I c ant take it anymore and I need help.

Today I went for a screening and the lady mentioned that ""Many kids come in for tests and majority of them don't get diagnosed due to them not actually having it"" this worries me

I am afraid that I will not get my diagnoses because of other people trying to get the help they don't need. 

Long story short, what do I do? Should I through with the $300 screening and hope for the best or should I just forget about it and go somewhere else?",adhd,QueenOfDepression,2018/11/13

* Drawing
* Photoshop
* Graphic Design
* Jigsaw Puzzles
* General Home Improvement Stuff
* Magic/Slight of Hand
* Video Games
* Collecting Various Things

These I've yet to really go back to (though sometimes things I've learned come in handy):

* Figurine Sculpting
* Model Making
* 3D Modeling and Animation
* Small Electronics/Soldering (I was making LED lighting for a display case)
* Coin Collecting
* Calligraphy
* Cosplay/Sculpting/Moldmaking and Casting (I didn't get past the planning stages for that one)
* Wood Carving
* Screenwriting

I'm sure I'm forgetting some, and none of that is including the numerous random projects that don't really fit into any category. It seems like I've always made stuff just for the hell of it.

A lot of instructions say that you're supposed to not change your experience and effortlessly notice things. However, two problems arise:

&amp;#x200B;

1. At least for me, noticing for example how my legs feel when I would actually just think about other things isn't atually effortless. In fact, it requires the effort to change the focus.
2. I feel like it is impossible for me not to react to sensual stimuli and just observe them. My inner reaction to some person saying something or some object making a sound is automatic and immediate. I tried changing this but it is literally like a reflex.

5185,adhd,"[Advice] I (21M) have suffered from depression for years. I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD, but I’m about to fail out of college. Please excuse any grammar mistakes.

To give some background, I have always had issues in school. I come from a family where my two older brothers are in med school and my older sister is working on her masters. In high school I was on student government, an active volunteer, socially adapted, varsity football captain, and involved in my church. I finished with a 3.5 GPA and 32 ACT at a competitive high school.

I was also diagnosed with depression in high school after reporting feelings of focus issues, severe insomnia, an over active mind, and feelings of worthlessness. 

I am a third year student in a midwestern state school. I struggled through my first two semesters of college without picking a major. 2.4 GPA.

 In the first semester of my second year of college I took a medical leave late in the semester to “sort out” my mental illness and issues. My parents, my therapist, and I didn’t come up with a sound plans. I didn’t return for the spring semester because I was taking a few community college courses. 

I returned to the same school in Fall 2018 feeling reinvigorated. I declare as a CS major feeling ready to take on the world. I took 15 credits, and failed 8 of them. I am placed on academic probation with a 1.7 GPA. I feel defeated.

I come home for winter break to my parents angry, disappointed, and exhausted. I explain to them that I still feel unfocused, unmotivated, stubborn, and fatigued. I see my internal medicine doctor and my therapist, and they agree to send me to see a new psychiatrist. My new psychiatrist sends me to see a neurofeedback specialist to test for ADD/ADHD. After 7 hours of testing (yikes) my psychiatrist concludes that I have SAD and ADHD. I am immediately treated with 300mg Wellbutrin before being sent back to college. 

It takes another few weeks for the Wellbutrin to kick in. At this point, I’m still struggling in school. Failing to turn stuff in, procrastination, not being able to study, and hyper focusing and being productive with random nonsense for hours at a time. I felt no different and at the end of my rope.

It isn’t until 4 weeks into the semester that I am prescribed 30mg Vyvanse. I notice an immediate change in the way that I am able to structure my thoughts. It felt like the things I had to accomplish automatically turned into a list. It was a relief, but it may have been to late.

At this point I am weeks behind in school. I’m failing most of my classes, and I have avoided my professors. I haven’t applied for student accommodation services because I forgot to. I know that my parents know, and I am worried that this is my last shot before they cut me off. I feel that I’ve abused our relationship and wasted time/money/resources/energy/love.

All I want is to be loved and to have a child, I want these things with her and at one time she wanted the same with me, we planned a future together, marriage, loving together and children. Then one day she ended it over a text by saying “She doesn’t want commitment and she thinks she will never have a relationship again with anyone, she wants be as a friend”. We didn’t argue or nothing, the day before we was laughing, joking and being a great couple, then BAM!! It ends.

I’m a good person, I’ve been told I’m a good person, I help out everyone and go out of my way to make sure people are fine but my life sucks, I smile at my family and make out I’m ok, I pretend I’m happy and laugh at jokes but inside I feel like crying because I’m alone, I now know I’ll always be alone and never have a family so why should I wait for the end? I can do it myself and be at peace because life isn’t peaceful, its mess.

I hear from my ex every single day, sometimes we talk on the phone for 3 hours and before and after that call we talk on texts many dozens of times a day, she mainly initiates communication so it’s not like I’m stalking her. The hardest thing is just being friends when I see her, its the hardest thing in the world to be like that with someone you really love. She knows how I feel about her and she has been more affectionate lately but hearing that she doesn’t see me attractive brings back my body issues again. She doesn’t know that her mother and I had a chat last night so now I’m putting on a smile and being nice and helping out and listening to other peoples relationship problems when all I want to do is curl up and die due to the hollowness inside me.

Sorry to ramble.

I pulled out a beer from the freezer at the perfect temperature (the point where it's so cold that it's about to turn into slush). I was reading a book at the kitchen table (meditations by Marcus Aurelius ironically lol), then took a sip from said beer. Instead of just downing a few gulps at a time like I usually do, I took a sip and really savored it for a few seconds. I know this may sound corny, but I felt like I tasted flavors that I didn't even know were there.

Then I realized that I was able to taste and fully enjoy my beer because I was in the present moment while drinking. This beer made me realize that for the past few years this is how I've been living my life. I speed through conversations, foods, and experiences by thinking about what's next or being distracted. I have these experiences but I don't fully enjoy/absorb all the emotions that are supposed to  be a part of the experience because I am distracted. It's funny how this beer made me realize that I simply need to be more present to enjoy my life more. ",mindfulness,ABeautifulPotatoe,2019/02/09

In October I began to experience some pretty severe anxiety according to my (also new) therapist - all because of a toxic work environment. Within the last month or so these attacks are no longer triggered by work stuff, it comes on when i think of just about anything. I'll be in a theater or at a show, laying in bed in the morning, randomly in the afternoon on a sunday.

It's just gotten so hard to recognize my triggers, and so hard to pull myself out of these spirals.

Any and all personal advice or stories are welcome. I think part of me just feels better knowing i'm not alone.

7080,anxiety,"Got a job shadowing opportunity and very nervous about it Hi guys. Just some background about me:
•	I’m 19F
•	I’ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder for about 7 years and have been doing therapy+meds ever since
•	I’ll graduate community college in a month with an associates degree. I also have a paralegal certificate

So anyway, I emailed a local law firm asking to shadow their paralegal to see if it would be a good career for me and they said yes! My first day was this Monday. I showed up and sat down with the paralegal and he told me a little about everything. His wife owns the law firm so it’s just her (lawyer) and him (paralegal). I’ve never had a job before (besides babysitting here and there since I was 12) and I’m very nervous. I thought I’d come here for some support and just to get my anxieties out. Here are some things I’m nervous about regarding the job:
•	What if they expect too much of me and I can’t live up to their expectations?
•	I don’t really catch onto things easily. I’m a visual learner so I might need to see a task be done a few times to understand it
•	What if I’m not fast enough at the tasks they give me?
•	What if they yell at me? I’m 19 but it’s hard for me not to cry if someone yells at me

I just feel that I have so much to learn. Even though I completed a 1 year paralegal certificate program, I don’t know nearly enough. I haven’t met the lawyer yet because she is at a trial all this week. The paralegal said that they don’t expect me to know how to do everything in a day or a week and that there is a learning curve but I’m still nervous that they’ll berate me or think I’m stupid if I make some mistakes. Im sure there isnt a lot of room for error in this field. I asked how long they would let me stick around to shadow and he said that it’s up to me and that if I stay for more than 2 months and they think I’d be a good employee then they’ll offer me a paid position. He also said that if I don't think the job is for me then to just let them know and I can go. The paralegal seemed pretty understanding and said I could ask him to slow down if I was getting overwhelmed. 

I’m okay with not being paid for now because I still live at home so I have no bills to pay, which I’m extremely grateful for. Interning for 2 months for free may seem long to some people but I’m jst happy to have the opportunity. The paralegal also just took a job as a bailiff so he won’t be there every day, which made me nervous because in my mind I was thinking “what if he throws everything at me and just leaves and expects me to do it all.” 
Im wondering if I should let them know 5hat I have an anxiety disorder or just wait a while. Tomorrow is only my second day so I’m still extremely uncomfortable at the office. I suppose the worst thing that could happen is that I can’t do the job and they tell me to leave, but I’m worried that I’ll be yelled at if I do something wrong.

Thanks to whoever reads this. I could use some support and maybe some advice. I need rational people to bring me back to reality! Thank you:)",anxiety,mlth7699,2019/04/10

Hello there! I mainly speak and write in Dutch, so if my English isn't the best, you know why. A little background about myself :) I'm a 16/M who's struggling in life right now. I can't go full time to school because of psychological problems, so i go to a psychiatric institution. My friends left me for my struggles and the one's I consider friends probably see me as a dude they know. Pretty painful to say the least. I also go to a psychologist every week, but because it's Easter, he isn't available. Alright, so my hobbies: I like to draw, sometimes hyper realistic, and sometimes I droodle things.. I game a little bit, not to much as it once was a problem of mine. I mainly play warframe and rocket league. I recently got a gym membership, so I have that going for. I also like to philosophize about mysteries and life in general. I like browsing the internet for fun and education, but mainly for fun. And last but not least, I really like to listen to music and to people. I listen to just about anything if it sounds good (I know that's kind of a cop out of an answer, but it's true). I can talk about almost anything, as I have deep interest in many things. My favorite talk subject is about things that are happening in our life's. I also like to offer advice, and help people in need. So yeah, that's pretty much me. One last thing, I come along better with girls than with guys, as most guys I met here in my school or in my psychiatric institution, only talk about their love life and their fortnite games.. i don't really talk about the love life subject to much because I'm a bit hart broken and if they talk about hugging and kissing etc.. kinda makes me sad I don't have that special someone. And about fortnite or just games in general, I prefer to talk about reality. Feels more 'real' haha.. but if you're a guy and you also don't like these things, we're gonna get along just fine 😉.

17085,lonely,"disconnective loneliness I don't have someone to turn to right now, but I wish to vent here.

For many years, I've starved myself from having a deep connection or 'closeness' with other people. I do have a small group of good friends, but they do not share the same experiences as I do and any reciprocation of emotions or feelings is limited. I've built a picture in my mind that yearning for such closeness or deeper friendships is ""needy"" and deterring. That by doing so, I'm placing an emotional burden on someone. Some of the people I know make judgemental (not critiquing) comments about others, which increases my fear of expressing myself.

Honestly, it seems to be getting worse as I grow older. Everyone is getting more and more busy with life and work. I only know a very small number of family, which has its own complications, as my mother and father are divorced. People have already established friendships that I feel I would be cutting into. It seems to me that over text I usually start conversations. I almost always initiate when it comes to asking people to hang out or spend time.

Given this, my situation is a bit strange. On first glance, I appear to be very well off relative to others. I'm graduating from university soon with an honour's degree and looking to pursue academics further on. My self-esteem is in a fair place, I'm dedicated to my interests and hobbies, I cherish the time a handful of people spend with me. I've had the pleasure to work at a job that I enjoy and have supporting co-workers and supervisors.  I consider myself to be in decent physical shape. I have many acquaintances that I kindly acknowledge and have good conversations.

Despite this, I feel so lonely. The lack of closeness has gotten to the point where I feel more alone being around people than being with myself. It feels like I'm behind a facade, that I put on a show everyday that highlights my well-being and suppresses my struggles.

That isn't to say that I haven't met anyone which made me break off this trend. I did meet one person in university about a year ago that I could really relate to and share experiences with. Sadly, while I was away on an internship, they became very ill, and at some point, communication was blacked out. Not just from me, but from everyone who knew them.

After my cat and I finished our breakfasts I threw everything into the sink along with the left over raw chicken and the Adderall.

Moments of color during the black and white where I just feel this excruciating emotional anguish. I see everyone in a relationship or otherwise in close proximity to others.

18793,mindfulness,"Dealing with unmindful people I’ll start off by saying I’m not perfect. I’m not mindful 100% of the time. But, over the years I’ve practiced mindfulness meditation to the point where I am usually pretty aware of the words and reactions I use in interactions with other people. Further, in arguments or in otherwise difficult situations, I’m becoming increasingly aware of the gap between a stimulus and my response to that stimulus.

So, here’s my question: how do you all deal with unmindful people. By “unmindful” I mean people who aren’t aware of their attitudes, words, or reactions in interactions. They just tend to react any which way. In this case, what is the “Right Action” the Buddha would suggest?

On one hand, I think it’s inappropriate to act as a “mindfulness missionary” and preach the virtues of mindfulness. On the other hand, it’s difficult not to say something to people like this (especially, partners, family members, or friends). What’s the so-called “middle path” in the this situation.",mindfulness,bejh25,2019/06/05
18885,mindfulness,"Question: How do I 'soften into something' Hi there,

New meditator here. I've been using things like headspace and following mindfullness meditation teachers for a while now but today as I was meditating I found myself asking myself about the process of softening. 

Suppose I'm meditating and the object is my breath. If I get distracted, when I notice that this is the case, I see many teachers say 1) notice it, 2) label it and then  3) soften into it. 1) and 2) are clear to me and I find myself consistently doing it. For 3) however I'm wondering if this means that my focus should shift towards my discomfort and away from my meditation object ie. the breath until the source of distraction disappears or whether I simply return to the breath and watch the distraction ie. observing it until it dissappears. I dont know if I'm making sense but it almost seems as though I'm stopping what i'm doing ie. focussing on the breath and briefly focussing on this distraction until it dissappears??? If that's the case then wont my mind constantly get sidetracked on the target which was the breadth in the first place. 

As you can see I'm a little confused and just need a bit of clarity on the subject. Any assistance is much appreciated.",mindfulness,livewelllovewell,2019/10/22

This has always happened where I become so emotionally dependant. I am terrified of being alone, Atleast after finding love, but I am fine after being on my own for awhile. It's like I NEED that person and I fall apart without them.

I've been with my girlfriend for a year now and quite often when we're talking about how her day went, she'll present a long list of complaints/worries about how she is doing in school, how she hates her work, external family etc.

We don't say negative things about each other i.e abusive comments or insults and are generally happy together, but hearing how bad she feels makes me worry alot, and brings back alot of anxiety symptoms from when I was going through the worst of it. She's currently going to consuling to get help managing her problems, but I'm definitely her closest person that she talks to about her feelings.

Does anyone have any strategies for being supportive while also being proactive about managing personal anxiety?

19330,mindfulness,"Does anyone else have this problem? when I was a child hanging around with family was fun, we was always close (and still are) and did activies together etc... but when I started secondary school (12-13 years old)  it all seemed to change. I suffer with severe anxiety (probably due to my asperges) and ADHD which I recently learned also makes it harder to partake in social situations but what I find a big problem is that I find it especially hard to even talk to the closest people in my life like my family members, even my brother, mum, dad and so on... for years I felt I was the only one and it confused me alot but I just saw a post from this guy who also is the same. so I was wanting to know how many other people have this problem? I guess for more acceptance that it's okay. I have recently started concerta after many different types of medication and I must say it definitely helps me but I still find it awkward to be myself and keep a conversation flowing and even if I do manage too, because it's so out of the normal for me I feel like it's weird and all that shit so I rather stay the way I am in those situations, for example the other day my parents wanted to talk about how the medication was going and me being me and all negative and shit I didn't feel like they was giving me the full potential as they could so I was there chatting away telling them how I don't think it's working as well as they can and I didn't realise how much I was talking and my mum turned around and said ""well something must be working as we can't get a word into you right now!"" and although that's obviously a good thing and a big step in the right direction as I've never been like that around them since I was young, for some reason it made me feel really embarrassed and my face went bright red and it stopped me in my tracks and I ended up not saying much after that. can anyone relate to this in anyway and if so WHY do I feel like this and WHY does it embarrasse me and freak me out so much to change and at the thought of operating like a 'normal person'

Most of my anxious thoughts and behaviors have to do with relations to other people. I like to be in control, and I guess people are usually not behaving in a predictable way, hence me anxiousness.

Sometimes something as small as a certain ""look"" or facial expression can trigger a thought and sometimes a loop hard to break. What did that person mean by that expression? I know my brain is an expert on making up fake answers to such questions, yet I have a hard time not believing in them and trying to find a solution/answer/fix.

My biggest trigger is thinking that people I love have somehow died in a tragic accident if they don’t respond to me. It’s getting more severe every time. I spiral into this overthinking mode, my heart starts beating super fast and I’m literally imagining that they have somehow died somewhere and I start to cry and hyperventilate and even though my rational self knows there could be a million reasons as to why they haven’t responded, my anxiety tells me “well maybe this one time it’s actually true”. And that’s what keeps me in this freaking out spiral that usually doesn’t calm down until I get in contact with the person or know 100% that they’re okay. It mostly happens to me with romantic partners or my parents (not so much them because they usually answer). 
It’s even gotten to the point where I check on snap location to see if they’ve updated it and if they haven’t, I freak out. It’s really taking a toll on me. I can’t sleep or eat when this happens and it happens multiple times a day with the same person. Does anyone have any tips on how to not think that just because someone takes long to respond or don’t answer the phone that something terrible must have happened?

6752,anxiety,"Is this an anxiety attack? For starters, I’m in depression and anxiety medication prescribed by my doctor. I’ve had anxiety attacks before that are pretty textbook. But im experiencing something new and I don’t know what to do about it. I’m in the process of moving between apartments, they are right across the street from each other. Today was supposed to be a packing and moving day, but the thought of actually moving all of my things to a new place completely shuts me down. I’ve only packed one box. And I keep driving back and forth to each apartment with the intention of making progress, and I end up sitting in the middle of an empty room just staring at the wall. I then keep getting up, and going back to the other apartment. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I called my boyfriend and started bawling. I just can’t cope with this move for some reason. What’s happening to me? I’ve never experienced this before and just thinking about it is giving me more anxiety",anxiety,lineydelrey,2019/07/26
4443,adhd,"How do i tell if i have add? i think i may have add but i’m not sure. my parents won’t let me get checked out because they think that i spend to much time on my phone and i just have short attention span. thing is, i don’t spend that much time on my phone, maybe 3 hours a week. i have taken a few online quizzes and scored “high” as in i probably have add but i’m not sure how accurate those are. Any advice?",adhd,bandiful,2019/08/10
4872,adhd,"Have my medication now, scared to take it. I (19F) guess this is more just to get it off my chest?? Because I know the solution is to take the pills obviously, I’ve been trying to get medicated for ages now. I’ve got the prescription and I’m filling it tomorrow (would have done today after work but they would have been closed by the time I got there).
I was going to fill it this morning at the chemist before work but I woke up too late and had to go straight there, and while I was cleaning up I was thinking it over like “am I just taking the easy way out of dealing with my problems?” And just generally thinking I don’t even need medication because it’s all in my head. Then I had such an AWFUL day in regards to concentrating that I remembered why I got diagnosed in the first place.

So I’m taking them tomorrow morning before work. I’m worried but excited kind of. I nearly cried today in the middle of the bar (where I work) just because it got on top of me and my manager snapped at me for something....like stuff like that I can usually ignore but I just welled up and tried to hide it. like the past year of crap had just come to a point of change/ending.

So I’m getting medicated tomorrow hopefully, if the chemist is open.",adhd,Little_RedWagon,2019/06/26
4434,adhd,"Looking for advice on social interactions I'm looking for a little advice here. I can't say for certain on everyone else, but I've come to a point where if I'm not actively engaged in anything, especially in social situations, I'll bring out my phone. Before phones were a thing, I still brought out stuff as a kid. I always had Legos in my pocket, or a book, or a game, but always something to do. I'm in a relationship where my SO is not fond of me being on my phone if we're hanging out with her parents, or just with other people, or even alone together. Like, we went out to a charity for her aunt, and she had for an old friend, and sat down and talked to the friend at a table. I sat down with them, but after a while, I got bored and started pulling out my phone because I couldn't keep my attention anywhere and needed something to do. I wasn't actively in the conversation because it didn't pertain to me, and I had a hard time hearing with all the noise of people talking and the music going. She was upset with my later for being on my phone and not socializing. Plenty of other times I have done this. 

After talking to my therapist, she suggested I try to make a game out of it to try to keep my attention in the moment. Try to guess what the next thing the person will say. I've been trying this but it hasn't been working for me because my mind can't think of what they're going to say and listen at the same time. I'm ok when it comes to a conversation I want to be a part of, if it actually pertains to me. I'm actively engaged.  However, I'm looking for advise if anyone else has found a particular way of being able to hold your attention, in the moment, in social situations when you're not particularly interested and having trouble holding your attention. ",adhd,Mr_Brinclhoff,2019/03/27
18962,mindfulness,"""Die to the past every moment"" In the book: The power of Now, Ekhart Tolle writes about how we should use past only when it is extremely relevant to the present situation and not ruminate in the past. So I do understand how ""that reminds me of... "" is a perfect example of such a conversation to keep having to ground oneself in the present and draw some insight.

But one question I had was how do we draw the line of reinforcing important events that happened in the past vs ruminating about the past and making your life miserable? How to tell which is which? This also assumes reinforcing important events in the past is actually important to be able to draw insights when needed in the present.",mindfulness,sekharcvs,2019/04/18
6852,anxiety,"Anxiety worsening and meds aren't working Hi. So I've been on Sertraline (Zoloft) for about 3 years. I've had my doses increased over the years as I suffer from GAD. I recently was feeling really okay and lowered my dose from 150mg to 100mg. This was fine and all was okay

About last week I picked up my prescription and it's a new brand, never heard of it. Since then my anxiety is coming back fill whack to my pre-meds days where I'm scares of everything from leaving the house, to going back to the house, to thinking about taking a shower. It's now putting a strain on my relationship a little as I then begin to worry about every little thing that could be wrong but is going perfectly fine in reality.

Long story short is it possible this is a placebo or the new brand doesn't work? It's reached a point where I'm having panic attacks at work over having to text my boyfriend back when this normally is something I don't even double think about doing.

I am not sure how to start this...I guess I just need somewhere to release how I feel before I drive myself crazy. 

I want to begin by saying I have a few close friends but all of them live on the other side of the world. I never get a chance to talk to them properly due to the time difference. I just feel so damn alone and depressed all the time. I miss having someone I am comfortable talking to about anything and everything from morning to night. 

I have been suffering from depression for many years now and most nights I just want to cry and cry and cry. I really do not see any point being on this earth. Nothing makes sense to me. I have a hard time expressing how I feel to my friends because I just dont want to be a burden to them. I am not sure what to do. I feel like I am going crazy. 

It would be really nice to just be able to message someone where I get the sense that they actually look forward and want to talk to me too. I dont really feel like I have that person in my life.

I feel incredibly alone. I have nobody to go to, and nobody to just let my feelings out to. Sure, I have “friends”, but do they act like a friend? No. They’re just selfish and narcissistic and don’t give a shit about me or anyone else. Kids all want to be “popular” in school, and almost everyone’s lost the value of a real friendship. I’m constantly ignored and my opinions are disregarded in almost every circumstance, it’s like I don’t exist. It’s like I don’t exist. I talk to nobody day in and day out, and now that it is summer, it’s really not helping my situation. 

I just want someone who I can trust, someone who cares about me and actually listens to me. It just seems so hard to find those kinds of people these days. It’s all about them, not about you. That’s how I feel about people, and I’d like to change my perspective but I don’t see it changing any time soon.

He also does corporate events, teaching people how to use their mind more effectively. He incorporates things like visualisation and metaphorically asking the sub conscious to focus on something else. Basically asking why it continues to want to repeat the bad habit  and then focus on something else that can provide a similar feeling. For those who have had no luck breaking out of habits (e.g cant lose weight, afraid of flying, quitting smoking) maybe give hypnosis a try?

For whatever reason I don’t even feel comfortable at home anymore, I’m more depressed at home with family, than with friends, and sadly the relationship with my mom has just really deteriorated (even though she tries but the circumstances just make it really hard for me to trust her), and I’ve never really had a relationship with my dad, like I rarely talk to him and we live in the same house.

I started using Metylphenidat in the form of Medikinet adult (retard form) yesterday with a dose of 10 mg in the morning. And 30-45 minutes after taking it I get super tired but not in a cranky way - kind of relaxed and calm. So I am not productive but kind of feel better as the tension is gone. I especially noticed yesterday when the meds wore off after 4,5-5 hours, I had no rebound like other people report but I got back to my normal state which meant some inner tension and restlessness. 

Of course I dug into the internet to get some answers - and tbh it confused me even more. Some people stated that in this case the dose might be to low, others said it might be to high and another option is, that it is just a side effect of the initiation phase and might go away after a few weeks on the same dose... I have a triation plan with my doctor to increase the dose after one week to 20 mg in the morning and after 2 weeks to 20 mg in the morning and 10 mg after lunch. I will see her in the first week of January to discuss and start my group therapy one week later.

19289,mindfulness,"Question on attending to breath + visual scape + sound + bodily sensation all at once. (Re: Waking Up App). Hi all,

I'm a beginner meditator and I'm about a month-and-a-half into using Sam Harris's Waking Up app. I've read here that the app is not recommended for beginners, which may help explain why I'm struggling slightly.

Harris encourages users to attend to all their bodily sensations and notice everything coming into consciousness. I'm therefore trying to soak in my visual field and sounds while also noticing the sensations in my body. It's obviously hard to do all at once. Sometimes I end up going back and fourth between the senses as if I'm turning them back on one by one. Sometimes I get slightly stressed by the effort, and while it's interesting to meditate on that feeling of stress, it's making the meditation less relaxing than it could be. 

Also, while I find it easy to passively attend to sight and sound, I find it really hard to notice my bodily sensations without paying attention to each body part one at a time. 

Every once in a while I catch glimpses of losing my body for a moment and just experiencing sensations. I get a sense of there being a beautiful thing there to go to, but I'm afraid I'm trying to do something that is not reasonable for my level, and that might be counterproductive. 

Should I have faith and keep going in this direction? Or have I misunderstood the basic project here? Or should I adopt a different strategy for my level?

4709,adhd,"I'm so, so tired of this. I hate that no matter how hard I try, getting myself to do whatever task I need to is nearly impossible. That if I open my computer all ready to do what I need to do, without fail I suddenly find myself on Reddit, or Discord, or something else, until hours have gone by and I haven't done a thing. And that writing this right now is my way of getting out of what I should be doing, right this instant.

I hate that I constantly get berated for every little mistake, but I can't even keep myself from making them. That I make a mess wherever I go, that I can't even think in the right order sometimes, but it doesn't matter, because if I stumble over my words or forget to do something that's automatically proof of my own lack of intelligence. 

I hate that nobody believes me when I tell them I have ADHD, that I'm ""not energetic enough for that, you're faking it for attention""; or that ""ADHD is like saying 'oh look a butterfly' and you don't have that!"" That no matter who I tell, I'm never believed, even though I desperately need help. And that when I express my thoughts like this, I get laughed at, being told ""You sound like an edgy r/notliketheothergirls person! Ooooooh we live in a society!!"" That's not it. I'm trying to be honest, and instead I've found I have to close off instead.

I hate that I get pitying looks from all my teachers, that look that means ""Oh poor dude, they're *that kid*"", even though I try as hard as I can. That even when I try my best and get the best grades I can, there's always something turned in late or incomplete or not turned in at all, and that always comes in to bite me in the ass. That all the adults around me look at me like I'm five years old and too stupid to understand the world; and that I can never tell my peers. So I am trapped in an echo chamber of my own thoughts.

I hate that I am constantly thought of - and called - stupid and inattentive, and yet nobody will ever let me help me fix the problem. That I fear going home because I know I haven't done something, and that the instant my parents learn of it I will be punished for it. And that I can't tell them why I didn't do it, because they don't believe me - they just think I'm too stupid to understand it properly.

I hate that sitting in class and just listening to the goddamn teacher is so hard, because my brain will inevitably latch on to something and run away with it. That time goes so fast when I'm off in my own head, and when I come back from zoning out I have no idea what just happened and I know for sure that I'm in trouble the instant I need to do something related to this.

I hate that even the things I enjoy - the things I know I love - are lackluster to me, for there will always something that grabs my attention in the moment. And that there's nothing I can do about it, because I feel as if I am not actually in control.

And finally, I hate that I cannot cry - I am not allowed to cry - because I am expected to pretend that I have the basic human ability of actually focusing. 

I need help. I really, really do need help and there's nobody. The rest of the week is looking hard - I'm procrastinating right this second and I was just screamed at for not doing something - and it's not like there's an end in sight. After all, I'm expected to work eight hours a day for the next fifty years.

19180,mindfulness,"Struggle with mindfulness of breath One of the primary things that I experience when I attempt breath meditation is a tightness in my chest and throat. The moment I start trying to pay close attention to the feeling of my breath the breathing becomes strained and difficult, and my throat feels as if it is slightly closing and resisting my breathing. The experience that I have seems to be due to a kind of controlling of the breathing as opposed to letting the breathing happen naturally. I commonly deal with moderate anxiety and fear, so it isn't abnormal for me to experience these tightness sensations. However, I don't seem to be making any progress in how I relate to this experience during meditation. I seem very caught in the aversion to the unpleasantness and the 'in-order-to' mindset of paying attention to it in order for it to go away. And the tightness quickly dissipates when I stop trying to pay attention to the breath, and comes right back when I try to pay attention again. I am not sure whether I should just use a different object of meditation, because I am aware that there is nothing special about the breath being the object of awareness. I sense though that there is something to learn here about how to relate to unpleasant sensations. I know one thing that I can try is to pay attention to the aversion isn't and try to find ease with it, although I have struggled to do that successfully in the past (tips on how to do this would be great). I also know a line from Joseph Goldstein is the thought that ""if my experience was like this forever, I would be ok"" and ""it is ok to feel these things."" I have made attempts to use these lines in meditation, and they have helped in the past but don't seem to be helping me here with this recent development of struggling with the breath.

4896,adhd,"ADHD and improv comedy Possibly my cringiest post yet!

I was diagnosed with ADHD 2 1/2 years ago and at roughly the same time did something I’d always wanted to do, which was to get involved in the local comedy scene. Here in Chicago that a lot of that scene centers around improv and after doing it in Ritalin for about a year and a half I actually started to not take my meds before shows and classes and... let me just say that improv is almost made for ADHD! To wit:

- One of the biggest gifts you can give yourself is to come out with a big emotion. What do we ADHD people have in abundance if not huge emotions? And you come out with it knowing you’re going to throw it away in 5 minutes, which, you know, also something us ADHDers know all about.

- The nature of improv is ephemeral, so if you’re getting bored with a scene, another one will be coming along very quickly. In fact, you’re encouraged to end them when you feel like that.

- also, the ephemeral nature means you can take some very silly risks and the worst thing that happens is that they don’t hit and you try something else. And when they do hit, people actually enjoy that shit. Can you imagine?

- literally my experience getting up on stage is turning my judgey, “dealing with my ADHD self” side off and letting the actual ADHD side run free. Have you ever had a friend who also has ADHD who you just get into wild conversations that are crazy and weird and, looking back on them, kind of awesome but which feel completely uncontrolled? That can be what awesome improv looks and feels like. I feel like the best shows I’ve had, I was like “I don’t know what the hell just happened but that was fun”.

- We did this exercise in this class I was in yesterday where it was literally, “your partner is going to tell you a thing about yourself in the world of the scene and you’re just going to ramble on about it for 5 minutes.”

- even the nature of “mistakes” in improv are like 99% of the time the results of giving into fear. Imagine doing a thing where afterwards you were like “man, that was fun, but I can see where if I just gave into my ADHD just a little harder, it would have been even better”.

- I literally get told I should yell more in scenes. Okay, not literally, but, like, close to literally.

Now, I have to disclaim that I really, really needed a therapist to walk through a lot of the stuff I’d done to control my unmedicated brain with and help me to realize that these not only weren’t things I had to do anymore but which were arguably causing me more issues in life than the actual ADHD itself. At that, I spent a lot of time beating myself up in classes and after shows over things I didn’t need to until I had that realization. And I do think you have to come in pointedly playful and silly, which isn’t always easy for adults to do. But it’s like improv is all about watching people with short attention spans manufacture crap in front of you, and suddenly the fact that we don’t always have a natural filter becomes a blessing and not a curse.",adhd,johnnyslick,2019/07/28

I can't put together the overall story of the dream (it was one of those weird ones, where different storylines just bleed together and locations and actions don't make much sense), but I remember this one moment in my dream, where he came home and just hugged me and said everything will be okay. 

I was somewhat aware, that I was dreaming, but not awake enough to realize, that this person does not even exist in reality. I had the random thought, that he is someone I got introduced to by a friend and how pleasant that dream was and that I should ask this person out. 

Then the alarm rang and I woke up completely, realizing that \_everything\_ in that dream was part of the dream and not just the relationship itself. No hugs for me. You guys were right about how cruel that experiance is.",lonely,This_Seal,2019/09/19

&gt; Procrastination is a perfect example of present bias, our hard-wired tendency to prioritize short-term needs ahead of long-term ones.
&gt; 
&gt; “We really weren’t designed to think ahead into the further future because we needed to focus on providing for ourselves in the here and now,” said psychologist Dr. Hal Hershfield, a professor of marketing at the U.C.L.A. Anderson School of Management.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Hershfield’s research has shown that, on a neural level, we perceive our “future selves” more like strangers than as parts of ourselves. When we procrastinate, parts of our brains actually think that the tasks we’re putting off — and the accompanying negative feelings that await us on the other side — are somebody else’s problem.

I think the distinction is quite clear: in the present bias, your mind is still in the thinking habit/papanca, and you still have the self. But it will be nice to have a bite-sized explanation between mindfulness and present bias, or maybe hedonism.",mindfulness,Ooker777,2019/04/01

16893,lonely,"Suicidal Rant My mother just told me that she and my father are thinking about throwing me out to go to an asylum (a place where people live together who can't live with their parents for whatever reason) This just gave me the rest. I didn't say anything and went into my dark room, staring out into the night city. Thinking about suicide. About ending this miserable existence. About slitting my wrist or maybe building an exit bag to suffocate peacefully. And now I decided to make a rant about my life on reddit.
My last year has been hell. I finished high school and was kind of happy for a while. Then things started going downhill, I started isolating myself because of my acne and I started smoking weed to distract myself, which made the isolation and social anxiety worse. (If you are struggling or feeling down, don't do drugs, it will not make anything better and probably just make things worse, only do drugs if you are happy and mentally healthy)
I had to start doing a mandatory job for my country (civil service) and things were going a bit better but I ended up getting fired after a few months over a stupid thing. Things went even further downhill from there, I completely isolated myself and rarely went outside my house anymore for half a year up till now. But I was completely in denial about my situation, I pretended everything was okay and that I was happy and I just did nothing and smoked weed and sat infront of my PC all day. My parents obviously think I'm a loser/failure, they are annoyed of me and I understand them. I can count the friends I have left on one hand and never even meet them. On top of that I have dealt with ADHD and bullying all throughout school. I am traumatised from the start. I suffer from several mental health issues: ADHD, social anxiety, depression (sometimes manic), paranoia, mild derealization and depersonalization and a generally distraught psyche, I feel like I'm going more insane each day. I can't sleep well and often have nightmares that show me my subconscious suffering and self loathing and fears. (I became more and more self aware and self analytical, which just made things even worse)
I am always tired and exhausted, my head always hurts and feels groggy to the point I want to smash it into concrete. Also I am extremely insecure about looking like im 14 or 15 when I'm almost 19, about my pale skin from staying inside all day, about my eye circles from never sleeping well, about my acne leftovers and about my hair and I am so insecure that I don't even want to go to the barber. And in 1-2 months I should start going to college, which I absolutely can't imagine happening at the moment. I really just want to get out of this weird existence, it would be so much easier, I hate that I have friends and family that would miss me, it's like you are trapped in this suffering through your loved ones. Also I have lost my faith in god over this past year, which has made everything so much worse. I became completely nihilistic. Why am I here? I'm just an intelligent monkey that randomly appeared in this universe, just to suffer. Why? Anyways, I just wanted to rant my heart out and am feeling better already. Maybe somebody can talk to me or leave me a comment, idk. Oh just a cherry on top: I had a crush in high school and she kinda liked me and we even got close one time when we were drunk, but nothing more happened. She now has a boyfriend and is happy while I am just thinking about that evening all the time in my isolated suffering. I am obviously still a virgin, didn't even have my first kiss, I am almost 19, WTF is wrong with me. Inside me I feel like I have this potential for love and sexuality, I feel like if I just had a girl and was normal/confident, we would be so happy together and I would give her all of my love and try to make her happy. I wish I could reset my life or just get a different one, because I love life itself, just not mine.",lonely,Throwaway528528528,2019/08/09
17336,lonely,"Just wanna get some late night thoughts off my chest I (20) have just been really lonely recently. Every day really I’ve been sad and I don’t know what to do. I’m at a point in my life where I really need to decide what kind of person I want to be but I don’t know what I want from myself and it’s killing me. After thinking about that all day I go home and..do nothing. I have no one to try and talk with, no plans to do with others, no one to really do anything with. 

I have people in my life who I know at least like me, but I just feel I’m not worth their time. If I open up to them about some of what I feel I’m afraid they’ll think i just want attention or something, I just want someone who likes talking to me. Lots of my friends are in relationships and I don’t want anything romantic (I’m asexual, which probably adds to that lonely feeling), I just want to experience having a friend like that.

I don’t know. I’m a pretty mediocre guy and I’ve come to terms with it. I know I’m not awful, but I also know I can’t accomplish anything with my life. I don’t hate myself, I just accept I’m just sorta ‘there’. If I were to have never existed, I doubt much would change to anyone.

18774,mindfulness,"How to tell the difference between disciplinary thoughts and negative thinking? So I am very big on using mindfulness to heal my traumas and righting my wrongs. If I catch myself losing mindfulness in social interactions and going on “autopilot” (which usually results in me reverting back to unhealthy behaviors to gain validation from people) I typically try to bring myself back to my mindfulness mid-conversation if I can, or I’ll spend some time in introspection afterwards. Asking, “why did I feel the need to act that way in that situation? What triggered it?” “What is a healthier way of handling that next time?” Etc. Etc. This inner dialogue has helped me grow immensely as a person over time and aided in healing a lot of my unhealthy behaviors. 

But then there’s times where I might feel like I want someone to just hug me and hold me and tell me I’m loved, maybe give me a loving back massage, or something to soothe me...but then I tend to respond to myself with, “everything you could ever need is within you. Dependence on others is unhealthy and you must learn to love yourself.” Then I find myself justifying it by saying, “yes, but you work in customer service, take care of your whole family, and always put others first...” and I find myself struggling to come to a decision - do I reach out and ask for affection/help, or do I use this opportunity to strengthen my connection with myself and do some self love?

The big one I’m torn between right now is that I never have the desire or motivation to text people back. I deal with customers for 9 hours a day 5-6 days a week. When I’m home, the last thing I want to do is text. But people text me and get offended when I don’t respond back. I say to myself, “you can send them a quick text to acknowledge them, you shouldn’t ignore people, it’s insensitive and rude.” (even though that quick text usually gets misinterpreted as an invitation to keep texting me!) but then the other side of me says, “oh well, I’m not responsible for how they interpret my silence. Take care of yourself, enjoy your moments alone. Relax, you deserve it.”

So what I’m asking, is how do you know the difference between valid self-discipline (especially if you have the tendency to be lazy like me, this inner dialogue can be quite necessary to help self-motivate) and just plain beating yourself up? I’m having trouble deciphering the two and welcome any and all insights! Thanks!",mindfulness,aquapio4411,2018/11/17
5108,adhd,"Fumbling in the last quarter, need encouragement? Advice? Hey guys. I’ve done so well this semester. My grades were up, I was submitting things on time. I was so happy to have started stimulant medication and was doing really well. Usually I start the semester with As and they slowly slide to Bs. This semester, I’ve kept my As up.Until the last two weeks. My psych made my prescription way too high, I isolated myself, couldn’t pull myself away from nonsense, got obsessed with journaling, and got behind. I stopped taking the meds, and promptly missed my follow up psych appointment because I was late :)(:

Now I’m still way behind. Finals are the next two weeks and I have turned in every assignment late for the last two weeks. I don’t have the medication to lean on, and I can’t get myself to do anything. All I’m ever thinking about is the work I need to do, and yet I’m not doing it. 

Today I left my stats homework until there wasn’t enough time left to complete it. I skipped class and told myself I’d do it to bring to his office. I’ll still get the late penalty though. 

I’ve been in this position so many times. I feel like my stress response is the only thing that can get me to do things. But I’m not really stressed? I think I disabled my stress response because I feel like I’m going to be able to coast and work it out once that fire lights under my ass. 

But that’s unrealistic. When that fire lights, I’m not gonna have time to do anything, and I’ll be fucked. Instead of a medium amount of stress over two weeks like I should’ve had, I’ll have a mental breakdown in a week when I realize I can’t get all As this semester like I so desperately wanted.

The thing is, I’m fumbling. I’m blowing my lead. I know it, and I still can’t get myself to do anything. I’m going to get Bs, not because I don’t understand the material, but because I was unable to put in the time and effort required to check the boxes. 

Any tips on how to get the ball rolling? I probably need to spend about ~4 hours a day on studying/homework to get at least three As. ~6 if I want that 4.0, which I really should get because my classes are so easy this semester. 

I miss the beginning of the semester. I was so focused and determined. I took great notes every day. I was going to office hours, putting in 110%. 

Now I’ve been late to every class for the past month. I skip at least 3 a week. I stopped taking notes a few weeks ago, now my notebooks are filled with useless doodles. I’d say I’m putting in about 60%. 

Luckily, I’ve removed self hatred from the equation. I just feel so sad and disappointed. I really could’ve done it this semester, and I’m just fucking up. 

Not to mention the increase in impulsivity. You can tell how impulsive I’ve been if you look through my Postmates account! Spending a lot of money on food that I don’t have!!! 

Anyways. I’m just sad.i don’t know how to jumpstart myself. Everything I’m doing makes it look like I don’t care. Any tricks you have to start doing things will help. Thanks. ",adhd,jennamyballs,2018/11/30

I've never posted in this community before so excuse me if this isn't the right place to ask but I'm looking for some advice on how to overcome my irrational fear of my neighbours' dogs.

We live in a rural setting - a couple of kilometres from the nearest village, surrounded by fields and clean oxygen. I've started to take up walking but I can't go further than my neighbours' houses because they have dogs. Yup, that's it.

[Here's a map marked with where I and my neighbours are](https://imgur.com/a/IF87IDN). What I've been doing to get my exercise is starting at my house, walking up to around 50 feet before N2's house then turning back and walking up to the railway bridge before N1's house. I'll do that a few times before I call it quits and stop for the day.

I don't want to feel trapped in that area because of my neighbours' dogs. N1 has very aggressive-seeming dogs, an Alsatian and a Rottweiler who will bark loudly, bear their teeth and come right up to the fence and sometimes onto the road which makes me completely avoid that area. N2 has a couple of non-aggressive dogs but as soon as they notice me and start coming towards me, I leg it back down the hill because my body tells me to 'GTFO'.

There's no reason why I should be scared of N2's dogs at least but it's a fear that I can't shift, no matter how much I try. I'll start off my walk thinking ""Oh, I'm not going to worry about those dogs and just walk past"" but as soon as I see them or hear them, that's it. Gone.

What can I do to try and overcome my fear? Thanks.",anxiety,streamidkhow,2019/09/10

I'm having a difficult time finding  scholarly material on the development of mindfulness after the Buddha's contributions around 500 B.C.; most academic journals and books just skip from 500 B.C. to the late 1800's (when Buddhism was being disseminated throughout the West).

I've had severe social anxiety for as long as I can remember, but recently my general anxiety about everyday stuff has gotten pretty severe. Been to a Doc about this, and have been prescribed Sertraline (Zoloft) 25mg a day. Haven't taken any yet.

The thing is, I am NOT depressed at all. I never have problems with getting out of bed, energy to do things etc, I feel hopeful about the future, I laugh regularly etc. I just have pretty severe anxiety about being around people, in public, extremely low self confidence/self image etc, extremely fearful of being judged/how I come across to other people.

Basically I want to know if it is worth me taking the Sertraline (Zoloft)I have been given, since it is an antidepressant, and I don't think I am depressed (just have anxiety). I don't want to make things worse. My sister started taking Sertraline (Zoloft) last year, but 100mg a day (extremely high I think) and has had insomnia as a result, which she deals with using Weed. The Sertraline has made her massively more confident and has helped her tremendously into starting a corporate full time job. But she started a year ago with just 25mg (like I have been prescribed) but has gradually had to up the dose to get the same effects. 

I know SSRIs effect everyone differently but I would really appreciate anyone's personal experiences with Sertraline - success stories or otherwise! Just really unsure whether to take the drugs or not. If it will be effective I will definitely do it, just worried about the side effects (insomnia/low energy, having to up the dose to get the same effect after a while, issues in the downstairs department?) etc...

We all are surviving and accept parameters to survive. People just say it is what it is, but that's sort of what makes it psychopathic to me. 
We have limitations. Fine, you can say you can push those limitations, but nonetheless these limitations are what this biological body gives us.

People have to go into ""mindsets"" to deal with life. I feel every fuckin thing in life is to coop with it.

Desensitization seems to be a trend as people get older, but since the process is so normal in aging it becomes ignored. This idea of social pressure is ludacris. We have to adapt to our conditions if we wish to survive. 

People worship surviving. People could not be living but just surviving. We worship that in life.

We worship the process because it's not changeable. We say ""if it cannot be changed then acceptance is the best""

The only thing that gives some hope is the nerds in silicon valley and across the world create something that breaks the chains of reality.

6739,anxiety,"Trying to get over specific work anxiety. At 25, I'm the youngest person in my department by about 20 years. I was hired out of school because of networking, the stars aligned, and it just so happened that they needed someone at a junior level because the organization is very flat in structure. I have realized that a disadvantage of this position is that I have no peers, and therefore no one at my level to bounce ideas off of, or to talk things over with before asking someone very, very senior. If I royally screw something up or even make a tiny mistake, it's in full view of my supervisor (who would be four levels above me, if the department was full of people). 

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, I've been dwelling on this a lot and have essentially started psyching myself out of every assignment, no matter how basic. My supervisor and another member have commented that there is typically a delay with the work I produce, it's done ""on the buzzer"" of the deadline, and that they would prefer for me to ask questions and to involve them more in certain things if I had issues or roadblocks. I have had to balance that against being periodically told, in response to some questions, that I need to do more of the work myself before bringing it to them. I was told during my performance review that all of the senior members of the department (so, everyone but me and the admin staff) sit together and discuss my evaluation en masse, which of course makes it even worse. 

&amp;nbsp;

So the end result, and what I'm trying to change, is that I put off submitting assignments beyond the time they're due, and I don't like asking questions. I also obsess over certain things for way too long, churning through the same research trails, and printing out gobs of paper in order to justify my position on certain stances I take. I should have submitted a draft email with a small chart to my supervisor two days ago, but I'm stuck on the idea that it won't have been done to her liking. Even though I know in my head that submitting *something* is better than appearing like I don't care or forgot about it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I would appreciate any insight or advice that you can offer. Right now I think it would be better to try and address the aspects of this that are in my own head rather than approaching my supervisor. As I get better about hitting internal deadlines and more willing to take risks, I may address some of the ""Ask questions/but ask the right questions/but not those questions"" aspect directly with her. For now, I just use it to illustrate part of where my hesitation comes from.",anxiety,SaltySolicitor,2019/05/31
19327,mindfulness,"mindfulness, sexual energy, mindfog, addiction and anxiety   

Hello there,  
 

I have a quesion regarding mindfulness, sexual energy, mindfog, addiction and anxiety, and I’d be glad if you could provide some insight on the matters I’m about to write down.  
 

Here are the facts:

1. Abstaining from porn and masturbation cleared my mindfog. But I only abstained because afterwards I felt bad, every time. Then I found a sort-of-mindful masturbation technique without porn and it made me feel great actually, nothing like before(without rushing, only hip movements, without over-straining any muscles, and breathing regularly-not holding breath, etc.) . So I kept on with it.

2. I started to practice mindful meditation; everyday from 1 minute(on days I’m too tired) to 15 minutes(mostly 10), and I’ve been doing it for 4 months now approximately (I missed 2-3 days of it though).

3. I was drinking fairly regularly(not much, but regular), and I realized, the need was connected to my anxiety issues. I tried to drink less, and I actually am drinking less(but we can say about %30 less). I wouldn’t get drunk though, only to feel the buzz(I wanted to mention this because I think the issue is not just about sexual energy).

So, from what I gather; My need for regular masturbation and alcohol consumption, or we can say addiction, is connected to anxiety. But these also make my mind foggy I guess, which decreases what I gain from mindfulness practice, and as a result, my state of anxiety doesn’t change much in the end.

Since I’ve experienced two different sides of masturbation(addictive/mindless - conscious/mindful) I don’t see it as something bad anymore. It made me appreciate my body and being in a new way – the sheer shift in perception was amazing. Also, I would say I have more than average sexual energy.

But if these regular actions, combined together, makes my anxiety last, how can I channel this energy? 

I think in Buddism you have to abstain from carnal pleasures, yet mindfulness, as a separate subject, seems more inclusive as long as what’s being done is done consciously. What is the place of sexual energy and sexual practices in mindfulness and meditation realms? And how can I keep on doing these things I like, as well as reduce my anxiety levels?  
 

Thanks a lot for reading, and thanks for your comments in advance.",mindfulness,vesuviflux,2019/07/22

It's a ritual to take a quick shower before bed, no matter how clean I already am or else I'd itch all night. I've always had sleep problems. I have social anxiety but that's unrelated to this.

The night before, I was unable to sleep. About five in the morning, when I was finally drifting off, I heard a beep from within the area of my face. I got my phone and used the flashlight to look around. Nothing. Weird. Ten seconds later, it happens again, this time my vision did something weird as I opened my eyes. If was hard to explain, especially as I sleep on almost complete darkness. Best I can say is it was similar to turning on a old TV.

At this point, I turned on the light, trying not to freak out. The sensation of dread struck me. I googled what happened and came to Exploding Head Symdrome. Whether it was actually that or not, I don't know, but I was too afraid to sleep, couldn't shake the feeling something very, badly wrong was going to happen. I also felt some weakness at the joints of my left arm and right knee.

I fell asleep sometime around 6.

I went on with my day as usual, feeling better after a rest, until about an hour after I fell to sleep. I woke up and noticed my room was a bit more lit than usual, I left the living room light on. My door doesn't do a good job shutting out light, gets annoying when my mom leaves the hallway light open.

Cue just ignoring it, and feeling something brush up my leg. I shake awake and look around, already at unease. I feel goosebumps as I turn on the light. I go to the bathroom before coming back and writing this.

Last semester I decided to take a psychological leave and pull out for the semester. This decision did not come easy as I'm the eldest in an immigrant asian family. In my culture, I'm expected to finish my schooling, get a ""good"" job, and lift some of the burden off my parents. But I was very suicidal at the time, and I was scared I would finally go through with it. I decided that for the sake of my safety, I had to pull out and seek help.

So I went to therapy for 4 months, I started to feel more stable and I am now back in school. I was advised not to find a job for this semester as I'm still transitioning back into the school environment. My parents have been hammered by medical bills from my grandparents abroad, and I haven't been able to afford therapy.

6651,anxiety,"Twitter and anxiety I know that social media and anxiety generally go hand-in-hand, but for me, I really struggle with Twitter.

When I was studying public relations, my lecturer told me the importance of Twitter, how it’s used by journalists and the media, and if you want to work in media, you really should also use Twitter. So, in 2017 I started using the site. 

Fast-forward a few months to when I started dating my current partner, who’s a journalist, and I’ve become wrapped up in my ‘vanity metrics’ on Twitter. 

I wasn’t really worried about how many followers I had, but now I end up feeling dreadful about myself when we talk about the platform, verification (her account’s verified, mine isn’t; because I also work in media, I wanted to apply for verification, but they’d closed the request process), re-tweets, followers etc. 

I seem to have no issues with ‘vanity metrics’ on other social media platforms, but I think considering I see this as a ‘professional’ platform, it affects me more.

One of my tweets got used in a major media outlet, but I really didn’t want to know, because I don’t want to equate my self-worth with social media, particularly Twitter, where I feel so out of my depth.

But when my partner has a ‘Twitter success’ she’ll talk about it, and I instantly start hating on myself. When her account was verified, she sent me with a screenshot and ‘jelly?’ and said she wasn’t going to help me get my account verified, which did upset me, because it seems a little mean. Even though I was trying to be happy for her because she was excited. 

If she’s happy and excited about something, I want to be happy and excited for her. So I don’t know if it’s something I can talk to her about, and if I do, how I try and still celebrate her ‘successes’ without feeling like Twitter success equates to my own self-worth.

Since I’ve noticed the impact it’s had on my state of mind, I’ve been toying with the idea of deleting it, but I use it for work… so it’s confusing. 

Anyone else have relatable social media anxiety? How did you deal with it? 

Thanks in advance.",anxiety,zilla_darling,2019/03/05
5089,adhd,"How are you in relationships ? What has adhd affected the good and the bad Im In my first extremely confusing (to me) relationship it’s complicated but I’m traveling so that’ll give you a hint as to why. Wondering how others are maybe I’ll see similarities and learn from how you cope! 

Cons 
- Hyper-focus on them A BITCH  
-Impulsivity towards wanting to run and end things 
- Need for control/ knowing how things are going to go ^ since that’s impossible strengthens impulsivity to just run 
- Fear or rejection THIS ONES A BITCH 
I get so excited when we talk on the phone or in person that I interrupt 
- Communication can be difficult because  putting emotions/feelings to words is difficult 
- Daydream 
- Hyperactive 
- Fluctuating attachment 


Pros- 
- I’ll always want to help - there for them whenever 
- High sex drive haha 
- I’ll get really excited or funny cause hyper
- I’ll ask the most random impulsive questions so interesting convos

I've always had difficulties speaking at a slow, and steady pace, and I'm not sure if this is a trait of ADHD, or something else - it's gotten to the point where I tend to speak so rapidly that whatever I'm saying is unintelligible to whoever I'm talking to, and I physically cannot slow down.

I'll try to say whatever it is that I'm trying to say as slowly as possible, but it still comes out as a garbled, unintelligible mess, or, when it's not garbled, and unintelligible my speech is so fast that nobody can understand what I'm saying.

So this has made things, problematic.

Does anyone know if this is an ADHD thing, or, am I just, fundamentally broken in some way?

I've always attended the best schools and lived in really good areas but because of this, I've always been the only black kid. I've gotten bullied all my life because of my colour and I just feel isolated. I'm a friendly dude and on the outside looking in, it's always looked like I have heaps of friends but in reality I don't. I thought that when I went to college shit would change but it's gotten worse. All my school ""friends"" have girlfriends so I don't see them and at college I'm still the only black kid, stuck doing a degree where they're legit only guys.

When it comes to girls I've never had problems interacting with them or spitting game. The problem is being taken seriously. I treat women with respect like what my parents have taught me but it seemes like that keeps me in the friendzone. I've hooked up with a few girls but that's when I was really drunk and they're the ones that had  to initiate the first move. Every relationship I've had, has resulted in me being cheated on and it's fucked with my  mental. The worst part is that girls have always cheated with close ""friends"" of mine. When girls fuck with other dudes, the niggas can treat them like trash and still get some pussy instantly, but for me it's like they always expect  the best  and I get nothing.

4645,adhd,"After the lifelong rollercoaster and months of jumping through hoops, I got my medication. Hey all,

I just wanted to thank all of you. You guys have made me feel like I'm not alone. I've always felt like the Omega in any group, and didn't know why. I didn't realize until recently that I had ADHD, or know what it was.

I want to tell my story as short as I can, to hopefully help a fellow lurker get help or offer something relatable to those who may feel alone.

---- Background Story Begin ----

I have a super conservative family, that doesn't believe anything aside from 'crazy' is real.

I made it as far as I did through finesse and topics being self apparent. The line in the road for me was Junior year of high school. I had failed geometry twice. On top of that, the one class I actually enjoyed - a computer programming class - had been taken away from me. My 'teacher' who was a half baked coach with no ambitions in life had failed me. He lied straight to the principal, and said he never saw me complete assignments, and the principal sided with him. I never tried in any class like I did in that one. My dad wasn't willing to take it to the school district, as he's super passive until he's not. It hit me really hard, and I dropped out.

I didn't know what ADHD was, but knew my mom and aunt secretly took my older brother to the psychiatrist for an evaluation when he was in highschool. He generally lacked ambitions as he'd already been torn down by so many years of not being able to focus. Medication worked, but he didn't. Like many say, meds are a car, but you still gotta drive.

After dropping out, realizing my deep interest in computers, I tried learning to program beyond the basics that were used in that class. I learned several web programming languages in a matter of weeks. I was spending an unhealthy amount of time programming. 12 -36 hour sprints, followed by 12-24 hour sleep and crashes. I loved it, soooo much. I became a hermit and gained 50-60 lbs.

(Context: my parents divorced when I was 7, and I lived with my father up until this point.)

Enter my uncle, who'd been queued by a father with no idea what to do, as I'd been unresponsive to everything he'd recommend or say. I moved in with my uncle, and discovered what family is. He motivated me to get my GED and get into school, which took 3 weeks and 3 months respectively. He was an old fashioned, tough love type of guy, but wasn't afraid to be vulnerable or honest with you.

After I enrolled, I moved out and rented a room from some 60 y/o Jewish guy (I'm a Jordanian/Palestinian and Native American). We got along surprisingly well for a while, but eventually ended up butting heads because I was super impulsive with my words, and got seemingly worse when I was anxious or depressed. I took on the task of doing 30 credit hours in 2 semesters at a community college, and transferred to the local university. Again, those general ed classes were either apparent or finessed.

Now I'm at the University, taking classes that require studying. I look up guides and tutorials on studying practices. I try day after day, set aside time, no distractions. I read pages over and over again, and have no clue what I read. My GPA plummets from a 3.4, down to a 2.3. I'm devastated. Anxious and depressed. I start to doubt myself, but I realize I excel with minimal effort on things I enjoy, and disastrously fail on things I don't have absolute interest in. I had a lot of traumatic and stressful family related issues and events happen during this time period, which further prevented me from getting the help I so badly needed.

It took me losing my dream internship of 3 years at a fortune 20 company, and a seemingly cyclical downward spiral to start thinking long and hard about it all. During the lowest moment I had, I acquired a 10 mg adderall. I was at the 'fuck it, why not' point, and took it to try and study. For the first time in my life, with minimal effort, I studied for two hours. I actually retained the information I read, and didn't reread anything. I started to research everything relating to adhd, anxiety, and depression. Maybe there is hope.

---- Background Story End ----

Having no insurance following my termination without notice, I had limited options. Layer that with being in school full time, self deprecating depression, and a lack of experience. Turns out when you get terminated from a prestigious company, you're damaged goods and no one wants you. Been out of work since April, and had to fight to get unemployment at a minimum. I found a community health center that does sliding scale payments. Guess what, they also have a psychiatrist.

After weeks of struggling with the general lack of professionalism from the receptionist and scheduling staff, I got an appointment with a therapist to begin the procedure. Three weeks later, I spoke with a nurse practitioner, who diagnosed me. Two weeks after that, I got my appointment with the psychiatrist. All in all, the process took 3 months. I'm scheduled to have follow up therapy this Monday, to make sure everything is good.

These last few months have been the hardest I've ever had in life. I'm choosing to omit plenty of personal details, but I want you guys to know that you all helped me through it all. It truly wouldn't have been possible to keep going if I didn't find this incredible sub.

So does mindfulness teach us to observe our thoughts and distance ourselves from the negative mindset? Or does it teach us to embrace the feelings (even if you don't like them) and not judge them and not wish to change your state of mind? Just confused as to which to do.

Knowing how to control and manipulate your own thoughts can give you insights in how other people are thinking, and enable you to better understand and perceive the world in ways you never thought possible. There is always more than one perspective, sometimes people just can’t grasp this fact because they rely too much on the same old tools.

4546,adhd,"ADHD has turned my inner critic into a monster I'm in my mid-20's, and have gone through most of my life undiagnosed. Since finally getting evaluated and diagnosed last year I have made some good progress, but I'm still struggling to deal with the effects of all the damage my self-esteem has taken over the years. 

Growing up, my time in school was defined by cruel classmates and disappointed teachers. Whether it was my constant careless mistakes on assignments or complete social cluelessness, the message I seemed to receive the most from others was this: *You should know how to do this, what's wrong with you?* 

At the time, though I didn't yet have a name for what was ""wrong"" with me, I did fully believe that there was indeed something wrong. When trying to fix it, I overcompensated. I filed the harsh words from my teachers and classmates away in my head, bringing them back out on a regular basis in an attempt to monitor myself. This was the birth of my inner critic. 

To my inner critic, mistakes were unacceptable. No matter what or how I had messed up, the same message played in my head on repeat: *You should know how to do this, what's wrong with you?* 

It made me paralyzed with fear. Afraid to put myself out there, to try new things. I knew that the standards I had set for myself were impossibly high, but I still couldn't deal with the shame of not meeting them. 

The voice of my inner critic didn't just focus on myself, either. It bled into my perception of others, picking out the flaws within every person in my life and making those flaws impossible to ignore. It shifted my attention to the negative aspects of every experience I had. 

Nothing in life is perfect. There's good and bad in myself, in others, in experiences. My inner critic couldn't seem to understand this, which made connecting with others and enjoying things extremely difficult. More than anything, it made accepting myself extremely difficult. 

Now that I've been diagnosed, now that I have a name for this thing that's ""wrong"" with me, things have gotten better. I now have resources to help me cope with my ADHD symptoms that have already helped so much. Despite this, the nasty inner critic has stuck around. 

See, my inner critic was my original resource, before I was introduced to the healthier ones years later. Though it's made my life miserable and is often my worst enemy, in many ways it also feels like my best friend.

For example, if one needs to lose weight, how does accepting the present help them move towards their health goal? The only way I can see ""mindfulness"" and acceptance helping in this case would be that: 

\- mindfulness allows us the tools to unpack the barriers to moving towards losing weight  
\- by accepting the present situation without the shame/guilt or the attachment towards the perfect weight/body composition, you can move on

I needed to understand shapes and line work and the importance of that and what it means chemically, scientifically, culturally and other shit.

I don’t know how I’ll get through 3 more years of high school. Last year I was a freshman. I thought I’m gonna make so many friends when I got to high school and that I won’t be so quiet anymore and actually participate in class.

I was very wrong.

I tried making friends. Every school trip we went to I tried talking to my classmates, but they just didn’t seem to like me. 

It’s always been the same. Before high school, I had no friends, I didn’t have friends in kindergarten and I don’t have friends in high school. 

I’m also really shy and quiet, but I want to have friends so bad. One of my teachers even said ‘you are very unnoticeable. You’re always so quiet, but you’re really hard working.’ I felt really sad when she said that, because she wasn’t the first teacher to say that.

I hated going to school everyday, because I knew I won’t have anyone to hang out with, apart from my one friend. But I want to have more friends. 

This year, I absolutely DREAD going back to school. I’ve cried so many times this summer, because I just don’t want to go back. I never cry, but I just hate myself so much for being the way I am. My heart breaks when I think about all the good times I could have with friends, if I had them. 

I’ve had 3 friends in my life. They were all girls as well. I would love to have guy friends too. I feel invisible and like no one would actually want to be friends with me, even if they knew me.

I hate it so much. 

I haven’t texted anyone in 2 months. I’m in my bed on my phone all day and I haven’t gone out with friends for 2 months.

I have friends but only a couple of them I can be real real with and he's usually too preoccupied with himself to care, and the other one has a crush on me even though I've repeatedly told her I'm not interested. And the rest of my friendships are fun but extremely superficial. As a college student living in dorms I drink quite a bit and I feel like I do it to be social because without it I feel I am boring. Last semester (my first) I really put myself out there and I was proud of myself, I met a girl that I could really see myself with and we were really good together. But for one reason or another we didn't end up together and we never will.

I feel pretty much un-wanted because I don't have anyone else to hang out with or go and yes I do have people who I know but I just feel like I'm worth shit.

16859,lonely,"How does someone wake up one day and realise they just don't love you anymore? Especially if they got you pregnant. My ex of four years and I had broken up in January but ended up back together in April, things seemed great. We weren't fighting anymore and we were close to graduating and life seemed like it was ok. Until he broke up with me right after graduation, then a week later I find out I'm having his child. 

His reasoning for breaking up with me was that he just lost feelings, they just faded. It hurt, it hurts still. We had an on and off relationship for the last two years because of some issues I was going through and I wasn't the best girlfriend at that time, but when we got back together I felt like things had finally changed and I was doing better. Then he kept talking about other girls, girls he's sent nudes to, girls he was talking to, and a girl he dated for a week. Non stop about the girls who were happy he was finally single... 

I told him about the baby but he assumed I was going to abort it because before we broke up he started talking about getting married and having a baby, to which I told him I'm not ready yet and that I had responsibilities still. Then he left me and for some reason saying I'm not ready for a baby meant I wanted to abort the one I'm having now? I don't understand where he got that from. 
We haven't spoken in four months, he's in bootcamp now but he graduates next month and were planning on doing an ultrasound together so he can see his child. His mom and I are on good terms and she's been a great help throughout the pregnancy, but she thinks we'll end up together again. She says he probably thought I rejected him when I said I didn't want to get married yet, but he still loves me. I don't know if I can believe that. I don't feel like I'm good enough for him now as immature as that sounds, I just can't bring myself to believe he actually loves me still. I'm scared to see him, scared to hear what he says, scared of all these stupid possibilities. 

I just don't know, it hurts that he just stopped loving me and knowingly got me pregnant and I say that confidently because the day we conceived was the day after I said I wasn't ready for marriage or a child. I'm rambling I'm sorry...I just don't know what to do or expect, I never thought I would end up carrying someone's child and be seperated. He's a good guy and no doubt would be a great dad, but he'll be gone for 4 years in the Marines. I'm doing this pretty much on my own and it hurts because why would someone put themselves in a position knowing the chance of getting someone pregnant if they didn't love them. I just don't know what to believe or what to expect when I see him. I'm sorry for such a long and messy post, I didn't know who else to talk to.

Even with all the lists, alarms, and life training, I still feel like I am leting thing's fall through the cracks. 
Intense desire to not finish things. When faced with a large task I do a lot of other small ones instead.
My mind wanders in conversation. I tend to go off on tangents. I really struggle with schedules and planning.
I don't feel like I have normal perception when driving. In difficult driving situations; like freeways on mountains with semi's, I just can't keep up with my eyes in my brain.

People say, follow your instincts, but I feel like I have been training to do the opposite, second guessing everything I immediately think because my impulse reaction to things in the past have been wrong. And had negative consequences that I regret.

It was in many ways, a nice fantasy world where you could be Peter Pan and do whatever the hell you wanted. I couldn’t see the the future nor did I see the consequences, so in some aspects, it was a care free existence. 

I can anticipate the future now, so now all I think about is my mortality, my existence in the universe and that one day I will cease to be. I should probably go find something to do because I have really bad RSD and isolate myself with my thoughts. I’ve experienced crippling grief, but it wasn’t something I thought would ever happen to me. Thank you, undiagnosed ADHD.

19730,mindfulness,"I'm 15 years old, and mindfulness helped save my life. 
My name is Abby and for the last 15 years, I have struggled with multiple mental illness, including but not limited too, extreme OCD, depression, generalised anxiety disorder and autism spectrum condition (which I don't consider to be a mental illness, but I group it with my other conditions). For the last two to three years, I have gone through a mental breakdown because of dealing with these conditions, and have not only engaged in self harming behaviours, but also attempted suicide multiple times.

This is not meant to be a sob story, rather a post explaining how my experience with mental illness resulting in me learning and practicing mindfulness, which ended up being a vital and key part in my recovery.  

In March 2018, I got admitted to a children's psych ward. By this time, I was already on a high dose of medication and had tried pretty much everything therapy-wise to try and overcome my OCD, which had now become so severe it was starting to make me psychotic. That being said, when I was in hospital, they tried something which had never been done before. They taught me mindfulness. And i'm so glad they did.

It started off with guided meditations and then went on to teaching me more versatile exercises and how to incorporate mindfulness into my daily life. And after three months of hard work-I was discharged with a whole new mindset. A happier one. 

Learning to be focused in the moment and acknowledge thoughts but not dwell on them, two of the key ideas in mindfulness had a significant impact on my mental health, my OCD/intrusive thoughts in particular. No amount of medication could have had the same impact that mindfulness did. I owe my life to it.

Now, 8 months later, I can firmly say i'm recovered from mental illness. I practice mindfulness on the daily, using the 'calm' app and read as much about mindfulness as I possibly can. I also like to talk and educate others about the concept, and talk about how vital it is to incorporate mindfulness into your daily life. Being free from mental illness for the first time in 15 years is the most freeing thing I've ever experienced. 

Now I can appreciate life. I owe my life to mindfulness. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my story,
Abby x

I was a seriously sad baby (Id think it was because I could feel the bad vibe from my parents) and my dad didn’t know what to do about me crying, so he would spank me for crying so much. When my mom left him when I was 12, he had a few weird gfs he was focused on and ended up moving a crackhead lady and her crackhead son in when I was 15 - forcing me to go stay at a safe place, my mom’s. Meanwhile, my mom has a new bf before they were even divorces and has been married twice since my dad. One time she didn’t even tell me she was married until after their “wedding”.

19732,mindfulness,"Wherever you are, be there ~ is a great mindfulness mantra and definition. As someone who has been practicing mindfulness and meditation for several years, I have developed my own definition of mindfulness.

Mindfulness is our ability to be fully present and in the moment, without dwelling on past events nor conjuring up ideas of a future that hasn’t happened nor anything that would pull our attention away from the present moment.

More simply put, my one phrase definition of mindfulness is this:

Wherever you are, be there.

This short phrase is straightforward and elegant mindfulness mantra and definition. Wherever you are, be there. If you are with people or doing something with intentionality, be there. Be there physically, mentally, spiritually, and emotionally. Be wherever you are entirely in that moment.

now when i skip taking it the lack of energy is a lot worse. i feel drownsy all day, it takes me a long time to get out of bed and i'm pretty much always ready to nap. i do manage to stay awake once i'm up, but it's nearly impossible to do anything productive in the morning and if i stay home it's almost a given i'll at least take a nap - if not sleep throughout the entire day as i've done plenty of times.
it's been worrying me a lot that if i ever decide to go completely med-free i won't be able go get to classes in the morning at all (i have to be up at 5:30AM at the latest, and was always incredibly late before meds), and i don't like the thought of having amphetamines on my body every single day without break.

I'm 26, bi, 5'11, white, fairly thin, and from Australia. There are a few things that I need to be specific about in order to find you attractive: you need to be white, not extremely overweight, not excessively bulky/muscular, and have no facial hair. Other than those traits, I'm not overly picky with physical appearance. I'm not really looking for guys older than me, so you should be between 18 and 26.

I'm looking for someone who doesn't have any friends. I don't have any, or family, and it's pretty much always been that way for me, although I'm not looking to change that really, other than finding a partner. I'm a very private, mostly-antisocial person, and although I have decent/good social skills, I just don't enjoy socialising with most people.

I'm very intelligent, caring, and mature. I'm looking for someone who is more refined than the average guy. Someone who can speak and write without making grammatical or spelling mistakes. Someone who doesn't swear much or at all, and isn't vulgar/disgusting in any way. Someone who doesn't drink, smoke, or do drugs. Someone clean, respectful, and more on the calm and gentle side, but strong at heart. I have a strong personality and I'm on the dominant side of things; I like to be the leader of the relationship.

The kind of relationship I want is one built on trust and loyalty. I want someone who will put me, and our relationship before everything else, as I will do. The kind of guy who is focused on finding a partner and simply being together. Not someone who is focused on working as much as possible and building a successful, busy career or anything along those lines. I want someone relaxed and stress-free, who just wants love and companionship above all else.

Let's buy and convert a van and drive around the country for a few months, or buy some rural farmhouse with a bunch of land and live a nice, peaceful life surrounded by nature, or just come live with me in the city in an apartment and we can play games, lay in bed, and talk all day. Which would you prefer?

But in the end I just don't feel the ""connection"", it doesn't seem like we ""click"" and get closer to being real friends. Idk, maybe it's just me and other people actually feel that we could have some meaningful relationships, but that's just how things go.

And similar thing goes for my older friends. We either stop talking after I realise that this person is using me/dragging me down/badly influence me in general, or we just never get out of this ""kinda friends"" state where we talk from time to time and rarely hang out or don't hang out at all.

Whenever I try to talk to a girl for a period of time I just get vibes that she's not interested and slowly give up the conversations. As you can guess, they seldomly message by own initiative.

I enjoy my major and the subject material or most of my classes but am exceedingly and absurdly anxious about administrative items and future prospects. My major (applied math) is quite desirable but for whatever reason I always have these horrific catastrophisizing ideations about the economy collapsing literally the day I graduate resulting in me never being able finding a good job and becoming a pathetic homeless vagrant. (People who don't land jobs at most a year after graduating face drastically reduced job and career prospect.) Having to work out financing and registration every 4 months while simultaneously dealing with classes, occasionally working and my damn family relentlessly haranguing me about anything and everything is incredibly stressful (much more stressful and difficult for me than any of my classes). I literally have no clue how other people do it with such apparent ease, although I know they do somehow. It's so bad that I wait until the very very last minute to register for classes and work out financing. My social life is essentially nonexistent so I'm out of the loop on things normal people might pick up just from being around others, too. This has resulted in my not being able to sign up for certain classes and as a result I'm on track to graduate a year late, which will also affect my career prospects.

If I'm not worrying or fretting about something or other, I'm daydreaming, binge watching tv shows/movies, browsing the internet or reading as a form of escapism. It eats up literally all of my time that's not spent attending lectures or doing mandatory homework. One of my favorite forms of escapism is 'Zillow vacations' where I peruse Zillow for sometimes hours on end looking at million dollar homes that I proceed to daydream about living in. Probably one of my biggest fears is living in an apartment. I really can't handle knowing that there are other people living on the other side of the wall -- it would make me feel as though I'm not in control of my immediate surroundings.

6371,anxiety,"A few questions about therapy, if anyone could help? Hi, I'm new to this subreddit so let me introduce myself.  I have never been diagnosed with real anxiety because I tend to avoid therapists, although I have gotten meds from a doctor for social situations before and several of my friends have told me I have it as well.  Since I have never been diagnosed though, I'm not gonna say I have anxiety, let's just say I'm an anxious person for this post.

Im in 9th grade, grades are not so great (at all), I've lived with ADHD my whole life and struggled with attention and friends because of it, but now also executive disfunction and motivation (I can get fucking depressed about not doing things and still not do them like a moron).  Yeah I know, that is excuse BS, but I do partly believe in it.  But aside from that giant obstacle in my life, I've started avoiding situations in school that have brought down everything in general.  I've been hiding from my cross-country team, not coming to ask my teachers for help, deleting every possible notification about homework to pretend it doesn't exist, etc. I don't know what to make of it, but knowing that I hate myself so much for it that I consider what suicide would be like several times a day, I think this is maybe different from a kid just doing his best not to do any work.  Or not.  Speak your mind.

Anyway, I've partly come to the conclusion that some of this is happening because it scares the living shit out of me.  My insides start burning and collapsing and I want to curl up in a ball when I think about situations like confronting a teacher, or retaking a test.  If I ever do get diagnosed for anxiety, I cant take medication because my parents don't really believe in psychotics, which I understand.  However, I was hoping therapy could possibly help.

All I want to know is, what does therapy do for most people? Is coping mechanisms an affective thing?  Do you guys think if I could get help on that I could get any better at these situations to the point where I don't just avoid them?

Also if you think I'm bullshit I understand.  I honestly could be I have no idea.

If I do manage to hand assignments in they tend to be shoddy.

Once I'm behind, I get confused about whether to prioritise catching up or handing in assignments. If it's catching up then I miss out on marks. If it's assignments then I might get some marks but then give up a lot of time I could be spending studying for exams.

I know a lot of this is just basic studying skills. But I find it really hard to bounce back when my schedule is affected by something random. It especially sucks when it's something like, forgetting my phone somewhere, or forgetting my bag in another town, or forgetting when payday is and spending it all a week before the actual date so now I have to rethink every single thing I do the last week. 

I used to think I would grow out of a lot of these mistakes, or that I could make more lists or something. The doctor doesn't take my suspicions of having ADHD seriously and I'm terrified of asking in case it turns out no, I'm actually just stupid.

I'm curious what your perspective on this is.

Some may say that feeling good about letting go of unproductive thoughts is actually two judgments at once (this is unproductive, this is good), while mindfulness is about not judging. 

Then again, I don't think bad (or good) about myself for thinking certain thoughts, I just recognize these thoughts as unproductive and decide not to let myself be dragged into them. Which ís mindfulness, if I'm correct.

I've always been lonely even when I was little. I've never been very good at communicating or socializing with anyone, so I would always blame myself for my loneliness. I was told and I thought over the years I would get used to it but it's only gotten harder to deal with. It's especially hard because I'm not that connected with family either. A lot of my family often doesn't talk to me very much. My dad hasn't been the best dad and just this year he completely cut contact. You'd think I'd be happy about that but he's still my dad. He actually would tell me quite often things like ""if you do such and such you really will have no friends"" or other things along those lines. My relationship with my sister was really good (probably the best it's ever been) but recently things have been very bad and I think she sees me as a failure now too. My mom is pretty supportive of me at least. My mom's husband really doesn't like me anymore but I won't go into that one. I lost my one last friend after graduation and I feel so disconnected (more than I've felt in the past). I actually joined a dating app, even if I just made some friends from it. but somehow it makes me feel more alone with conversations ending so quickly.

I have no opportunities, but want to learn how to make some. 20 year old college drop-out, stuck living with my toxic family, jobless (sort of. working part time at my dad's factory helping out in the office six hours a week), suffering from severe depression and social anxiety disorder. I have a sparse handful of friends, several of them very close, but only two do I regularly talk to and occasionally hang out with. Obviously, given my major anxiety I'm a definite introvert, but I can survive conversations with strangers for the most part, despite being extremely uncomfortable with doing so irl.

The main problem is that I don't have any opportunities to meet people my age and make friends, or find a potential romantic partner. I'm not attending any school, I never leave the house except to go to work at the office (my dad and I are the only people \*in\* the office, and everyone else are 30-40 year old factory employees, not the kinds of people I'd like to talk to), so I have zero physical, irl opportunities to talk to people. As for the internet...I've tried Bumble and Tinder. I must have seen hundreds upon hundreds of profiles and only ever matched with one person, but a week of texting them made me realize they weren't my type.

4902,adhd,"Withdrawal Trubs 2: The Saddening Back to jam more about my adventures through Adderall withdrawal.

After two weeks of apathy/anhedonia, I'm finally starting to feel *human emotions* again. During the day I feel alright; not as sunny as I used to be, but more down to do fun things and hang out with friends. Once it gets closer to nightfall, however, the depression slowly sets in. Prior to being on medication, I'd never experienced nighttime depression, so I'm assuming this is yet another withdrawal symptom entering the mix.

It sucks, because nothing in particular happens that sets it off. I just slowly feel my mood begin to lower until it tanks altogether, and my brain tries to rationalize the feeling by coming up with reasons to feel sad and hopeless. This starts around 6pm and doesn't stop until I go to sleep. 

Right now my coping strategy is to just distract myself with videos or games, but I miss out on a good chunk of the evening that way. Plus my brain is usually where I like to retreat and daydream up fun story ideas and art concepts, so it's a bummer when the sadness blocks me from accessing that.

The thing is... I literally can’t *focus*. It feels like I can’t focus on ANYTHING anymore! Throughout Middle School, I’d zone out during class without realizing it. I know everyone does this, but I’d do this almost every single class period to the point where I don’t even remember the class even happening. When tests came, I’d whisper to my friends “we never learned this” and they’d say something like “huh? we spent a whole day on this, remember?” And it made me feel stupid and dumb.

Not only during class will I zone out, but during conversations as well. My mind will wonder places and I can’t help it, often I don’t even realize what’s happening. Then when I snap back to reality, I ask “what?” to my friends while they’re talking, wondering what they’re talking about. They’ll give me an annoyed look and ask why I wasn’t paying attention. I always reply with “sorry, I spaced out!” and they just scowl and explain what they’re talking about.

This happens during family dinners too. My oldest brother always gives me crap for it, calling me stupid or dumb for not listening to what my siblings are saying. I’ve explained to all my friends and family calmly that I seriously can’t control when I zone out, but they always say “everyone daydreams sometimes”. I just want to scream at them “I CANT FREAKING CHOOSE WHEN I STARE OFF INTO SPACE”

The worst part... this one time I was talking with my parents privately, explaining how my grades in high school matter more than middle school and that I should try to seek some help with what I have. But then my dad said “You may have ADD, but we’re not getting you diagnosed. The medications seriously slow down maturing and I think you can learn to control what you have with some time.”

19137,mindfulness,"My idea on quite logically reasoning the existence of consciousness after death As for few words to begin with:
Well, so there is an idea i had years ago and had little chance to develop. I could not find any more information about similar idea existing before, or people who could add or take anything to or from it. I discussed that with few curious individuals, most agreed with my point, some did not. Still, it didn't go any further, so here I'm looking for new ideas and more details about subject. Also, English isn't my first language so feel free to point out any inconsistencies.

So, let's imagine your timeline. Staring with birth, ending with death, and you, somewhere in-between. Preasumably there's no evidence of anything existing beyond final point of this line, so let's say there's nothing, just emptiness.

Now let's imagine, timeline of someone with complete literal amnesia somewhere during existence of their consciousness. Line looks like one of any other human, though there is a point before which no consciousness exists. Said person wakes up in hospital and that's their first, and at the moment, only memory. In their subjective sense, their existence starts with this point and objective view has nothing to do with it. Of course they existed before this moment, but not within their current and only consciousness. I'm explaining this with detail because many people loose their mind at this point saying ""you don't remember your birth but you existed then"". That has nothing to do with theory and just means they did not understood earlier point.

Knowing what we know at this stage, we can deduct that event like this can't occur during our lives, of course only subjectively. If that were to happen, we wouldn't enjoy consciousness of this current moment, everything would start with us ""waking up"". I should say I instead of Us to not confuse anyone as all this is once again subjective. We can't go any further without agreeing with this point, and I'm not so great in explaining this theory so you can ask questions now if you will.

Now let's imagine moving point of 'complete amnesia' on the timeline. Of course if dragged closer to beginning it would happen earlier and if placed near end, it would happen later, effectively making a conscious life longer or shorter.

But what if end point would also be point deciding about us being conscious or not? What if death would be complete amnesia? All nerves die, brain comes apart. There's nothing of our personas left. So it's the point before which consciousness didn't exist but also point after which there's nothing too? If that was the case, what me being conscious at the moment say about point which ends the timeline of my own consciousness? Doesn't my awareness disprove anything like that happening ever after current point?

If I can, from the fact that I'm conscious at this moment, deduct that I'll never loose my current self in complete amnesia, it will never happen, but death is effectively same thing, just without anything beyond it to learn about it happening. Doesn't it finally have no sense? Isn't it a logical proof of human consciousness once experienced being unending?

I'm open to discussion, peace.",mindfulness,DmnOnReddit,2019/04/10

* I had a very strong pain in my heart area so i went and checked it at a medic and my heart was completely fine according to 2 electrocardiograms, and after that it suddenly vanished.

* I have some drunk like diziness in public places like restaurants or pubs, but almost never at home.

* I sometimes check my breath rhythm.

* I feel a weakness in my right arm but the arm is completly fine, being able to do anything just as fine but it feels weak.

* I feel a part of my face numb but in reality it isnt.

Sometimes I wish he would take me back, other days I say no way cos of some of the stuff that happened but I don't know. At this point I want him to be my friend again. I miss my best friend. He was my only real friend for over a year, I've never really been great with keeping long term close friends. And now we hardly talk and it breaks my heart. What's worse is that after we broke up, my depression peaked (I can't tell him I have depression either) and now I'm so miserable on my own with everyone aware I have depression but never ever trying to hang with me even tho I try so hard to act fine in front of everyone. And the worse part? I can't do anything about it for the rest of the year because I'm stuck with these people until Uni hits next year and then I'm free of these fuckers.

I went to a spin class this morning and got my ass kicked but as I was spinning away i was thinking about the ability to focus and tune out the world when confronting obstacles or in moments of intense physical activity vs. mindfulness. 

Mindfullness requires you tune out the world in your head and focus on what is real around you while focussing in sports or what requires you to make up stories to tell yourself so you can push past the pain.

Anyone have thoughts about this or book recommendations that would talk to this?",mindfulness,themattmans603,2018/12/23
19595,mindfulness,"How can I maintain calm in stressful situations, especially with regards to driving/vehicle issues and breakdowns? I have been having huge trouble staying calm lately. 

I co-own a 400+ acre family farm with my sibling, but essentially do all of the upkeep and work. I enjoy it, but I live elsewhere so I only get to do this work on the weekends. I have learned to take each task one at a time. If I didn't, I would stress out at all of the work that needs to be done. I've made great strides in this, and I'm chipping down the list pretty well. 

This past weekend, I had an event several hours away and had to take my horse. It's something I do every year. I took our farm truck to a shop 2 weeks beforehand to get it checked over due to warped rotors. Unbeknownst to me then, it needed a LOT of repairs. All were safety issues (cracked tire rod, ball joint, brakes, rotors, etc). It was costly. 
Halfway there, I stopped for fuel and noticed a burning smell from one side of my tires. I thought it was a caliper issue and called the shop. They assured me that if it was driving okay, it was safe to drive. So I went ahead and drove on. We arrived without incident, but while driving just the truck around the next day, the brakes seized. I had to have it towed to a shop and the calipers needed replaced. This meant that I had to get a rental vehicle (which ended up being expensive). After picking up the truck, I drove it 20 miles and the calipers smelled hot again. I called the shop, but they were closing and couldn't do anything that day. I had to leave that evening, and I didn't have anywhere to stay, no rental car, no one to contact. I felt so alone. I ended up chancing it and drove home slowly. Nothing seized or smelled hot, but I braked as little as possible. 

To add to this, i was staying with my cousin's old friend while there, and my cousin's mentally unstable boyfriend had her call me to complain that I was staying with her friend, then proceeded to threaten my farm. (Yes, it makes no sense at all since my cousin instigated the introduction.) So I had to call the sheriff and ask them to watch my place in case he decided to attempt arson. I have cameras, and my brother (who is on a work trip) was watching 24/7 as well. 

Between all of this, I had several absolute meltdowns. I just couldn't stop crying. I was worried about my house and animals at home, worried about possibly getting into an accident with my horse and killing her, worried about all of the money that this was costing me. And while the horse event was fun, I was so wrapped up in everything else happening that I couldn't focus well and it hurt my experience. 

What can I do to try and stay calm and separate myself from my emotions during times like this? I have a tendency to think of all the ""what ifs"" and I can't seem to shut that part of my brain off. I'm thinking that maybe I need counseling again, as this anxiety has started to impact the things I want to do.

7096,anxiety,"I can't stop the intrusive thoughts in my head and compulsive guilt trips. Please help. A bit of context: I've been suffering with a constant feeling of guilt and anxiety for as long as I can remember. As a kid it was more sporadic it would express itself as anxiety attacks where i'd feel like the worst person in the world for something insignificant I had done in the past (take something home from school that wasn't mine, cheated on a test, said something mean to someone in the playground). I'm 24 now and since I was at least 18 it has been a constant sense of guilt, culpability and anxiety that I cannot shake, not even for a second no matter how much fun I'm having, I never feel at peace with myself.

I often get violent episodes where flashbacks of shameful things I have done in the past rush to my brain and repeat themselves for hours and sometimes days on end. I want this post to focus on the intrusive thoughts I'm having right now rather than the history of my anxiety.

Please help me. It's been 48 hours. I was lying in bed on Sunday morning and a memory flashed in my head out of absolutely nowhere. I remembered a picture in my yearbook where we were at a conference with my class taking a group photo, 7 years ago. There was a serious photo, and a ""fun"" photo. While everyone is making silly faces I turn around and hug my male friend and give him a kiss on the cheek. It looks really inappropriate and it certainly WAS inappropriate. It looks worse than it sounds. Our school principal is standing behind me, and I'm pretty sure the dude I'm hugging had a girlfriend at the time. Now that book is sitting on people's shelves and I'll be remembered as the school slut forever. Why couldn't I just be like the others and make a silly face? Why did I have to behave like that? Why did I think that would be a fun memory to look back on ?

For the past 48 hours I've felt sick to my stomach, hardly eaten, have had a voice constantly telling me ""you're a whore! You're a slut! Everyone knows and that's why you never had meaningful relationships with people in school! That's why no one liked you!"" On repeat. Again and again. I was definitely promiscuous in my final years in school, I didn't notice the pattern at the time but I tended to go after other girls' boyfriends. After being the model child till 15 I snapped one day and started whoring out. I'm so ashamed that now due to a number of other factors as well (several types of horrible anti depressants that killed my libido, a failed long-term relationship I feel responsible for and a series of fucked up experiences with boys) I hate sex. I'm terrified of it. I think I don't deserve it and I don't want it anymore.

I hate myself.

I've reached out to my psychoanalyst, I have an appointment in 2 days. I haven't seen her in a year. My anxiety is constant, I'm never not anxious and I very often get these intrusive thoughts and flashbacks that make me feel so ashamed of myself. It's so bad that even when I'm in the shower or trying to fall asleep I need to put a show on in the back ground so I can concentrate on someone else's voice than the horrid sound of my own voice in my head constantly telling me you're a bad person! you're a slut! you're an embarrassment! people were right not to like you!

17308,lonely,"Feeling like I wasted 4 years of university I had some friends in high school, and I looked forward to making friends in university.

Couldn’t be further from the truth. Turns out, as time went by, I became more and more self-conscious, which made making friends that much harder. 

I thought I would have the typical uni experience of every young person...fun, exciting, filled with new experiences. Except I found myself spending most nights alone in my room.

Don’t get me wrong. I wasn’t a COMPLETE loner. I had a handful of friends. But I didn’t have a best friend, or even a really close one. 

I thought at least, maybe I’d experience some romance. After all, where else in life would it be easier to find a special someone? So many cute and smart guys around me, if only I could just talk to one. Nope. Never happened. Not even a single date.

I’m not mad at anyone, or anything. I’m not even mad at myself. Even if I could go back in time and do these past 4 years all over again, I don’t think much would have changed. I was always that awkward quiet girl, ever since I could remember. As the years went by, it got better in some ways and worse in others, but I was never completely happy. A small part of me was always lonely and starved for company.

At the end of the day, it all comes down to personality. Some people have personalities that let them make friends with anybody they meet, that lead them on crazy adventures and experiences. Other people are best suited to spending the days watching others live their lives. I want to say I’m okay being on my own, but sometimes I’d like to have someone to talk to who isn’t my mother. Sometimes I wish I had a friend.

19342,mindfulness,"'Check-in' every time you sit down This is a simple practice I have found very useful for integrating mindfulness into everyday life. I hope it is helpful to some of you.  


Every time you sit down during the day, you can pause and pay attention to the first two breaths (in-out, in-out) as you would during formal sitting meditation. This sounds pretty insignificant, but it makes a huge difference in breaking up any long periods of 'mindlessness'. It is particularly good because often I find that spending time on the computer is when I become the most lost, and so to come back to the present moment every time I sit down in front of the computer (or on the couch, car seat etc.) makes it much easier to stay mindful. It is almost like a mindfulness safety net to catch you during the day.  


If you do try this it may take a little while to become automatic but you can end up making it a habit. You will also probably notice that you sit down a lot more than you realise!

***Here's the content that I accidentally clickbaited for***

I wake up every morning from the nightmare that are my dreams and suddenly reality isn't that bad. I take a alternative medication to Adderall called consectuta, it basically induces panic and my weak ass endocrine system that's been devoid of most basic functions is overloaded and the potency of the induced hormonal panic is a bit much for me, thus my brain activity during rest makes me have terrifying nightmares. But it's still better than taking Adderall and risking a dependency on it? 

***Basically the main story***

To put into context, my family might have a high disposition to depression and my grandfather had fried his brains off of prescription meds after my grandmother died (he was a pharmacist before he retired, he self prescribed and well I'd cut it short...) So my first meeting with a therapist in 10 years was a bit of a weird one. In the past I had a diagnosis of borderline ADHD and a prescription to Adderall, that didn't go well with my mother's (and recently my own) fear of me developing a dependency upon it, which since I was borderline I was placed on a trial period of 2 months, which afterwards was decided I wouldn't continue until my condition had gotten worse. Which leads to now as my borderline ADHD has become a fully fledged case of ADD, not Terrible and the alternative medication is much better but a single issue. The medication invokes panic normally, the kind that makes eating hard, heavy chest, and the usual borederline inability to notice anything that you don't place into high importance (suprisingly makes me forget my tinitus through the entirety of the day) but it has a weird issue that whenever I take it, I fear falling asleep as the dreams that occur are lucid but the type where you've been placed against a opponent far more influencal on the realm. Mostly the dreams follow tragedies I've repressed, and emotions I had long forgotten about, followed by potential events/outcomes of things I fear I may have caused like; fires started out of my ineptitude, accidents with brutal consequences, and emotional scarring that left me in tears and have stuck with me even after waking up, sedimenting themselves in a similar way to actual memories. But it's only linked to my deep requirements for nessisity for extreme focus since I feel I function adaquetly without any medication (albeit I have to be extremely careful and deaficated to a task)

***More storytime since I'm inept at keeping a continuous stream of thought***

Well, it's mainly my issues of how I've copped with some other issues (moving from the states to India, death of grandmother, grandfather frying his brain, uncle's suicide, and my introduction to my families recessive disposition to depression) which was a complete transference from happy go lucky to my current state of apathetic, pessimistic, and listlessness. And to my surprise the medication was a bit more effective at invoking emotions I had forgotten for years but that's just the stupid side of me that forgot that it's literally a medication that invokes hormones... Something that my body failed to do (thus the genetic disposition to depression and such emotional relapses)

4742,adhd,"How to communicate with someone who has ADHD? (my partner) My GF and I have been dating for a little over 2 years and are about to move in together. I'm losing half my closet but gaining 24/7 cuddle availability (it's a fair trade I figure). She has ADHD and is taking Dr. prescribed medication for almost 2 years now.  It certainly helps and I can tell when she is late taking her meds, even by a few hours.  Conversations are more jumbled and things are more confusing for her when she's late taking them.  It's like she just woke up and is slightly confused at everything. 

But even on her meds there are still significant challenges and I'm looking for some advice on what to do next.  I've read all the articles she's sent me (okay most, not all), watched the videos, chatted for hours about how she processes things differently and how everything for her is different.  I would say I'm much more informed than the average bear.  

Tonight we were chatting as we often do and I asked her a question about how she was feeling about us.  Things have been a little off the past few days and we haven't been connecting as good as we usually do.  A good time to check in I figure and see what's going through her thoughts and how she's feeling.  So I asked her ""how are you feeling about us right now?"" 

A few minutes later and a lot of talking on her part she didn't answer the question, and was doing something she often does which is self stray from one topic to another to another eventually ending up so far off track that I don't have a clue what point she is trying to make.  I think it's fair to say this happens about 80% of the time (or more) whenever we try to talk about anything complex.  

I'm a pretty good listener and I don't mind paying attention for long periods.  In the beginning of our relationship I would just sit and listen.  5 mins, 10 mins, 20 mins, 30 mins, even going as much as 45 minutes of not saying a single word back after I would ask the original question.  Sometimes it was a more serious relationship question and other times it would be just casual chit chat.  

So here's where I'm stuck.  If I just listen and listen and listen ... the question almost never gets answered.  And often if I interrupt to ask if she's going to somehow swing this around to come back on topic she will pause .... and ask me ... ""what was the original question again?"" And believe it or not it actually starts all over again.  

If I wait or interrupt and say, ""this has nothing to do with what I asked"" I get told I'm impatient and/or I need to rephrase the question better.  If I ask how should I ask the question she (eventually) says it 99.9% like I asked it the 1st time.  

No matter how I ask, how long I wait, if I interrupt or not, if I rephrase or don't, I seldom get an answer to whatever I've asked.  If I become direct. She tells me I don't understand her and how hard it is for her to focus with ADHD and she needs to add the other parts in.  She often gets upset at me in the beginning then frustrated at herself after she calms down. She does say I need more patients and I admit sometimes I just want a quick answer to something like a regular conversation and i get frustrated. 

So lately I find myself avoiding conversation and at times communicating all together with her.  Or if she starts to drift off track while talking I will reminder her once and if she starts to drift a 2nd time (without ever coming near answering anything) I just cut her off and ""don't worry about it, I'm good"".  Usually i know the answer isn't coming from experience and/or I'm mesmerized at this point and just need to check out for a bit as I'm confused at what point she's trying to make.

I admit that most of the time I laugh it off and so does she.  I'm like what does ""tidal wave energy"" (15 mins later) have to do with "" hey babe, what would you like for super?""  But sometimes I just want to know how she's feeling or what she wants for super.

I've barely been anxious about the big one, probably because at this point, everyone says it's going to happen at the EXACT year, and it never does. Granted, I knew it was inevitable, but it wasn't enough to make me so paranoid. But now, I'M at that point.

I've been through earthquakes before. A 5.6 back in 2007, when I was still a kid (AND when natural disasters were my biggest fear. Didn't give me trauma), and I've slept through earthquakes. But a 7.8...now, I don't believe it will be anything like those disaster movies. I believe all that will happen in my area is that a lot of crap will break in my house, but it won't be demolished. YET, it's the aftermath I'm more worried about. All those buildings gone, or just the fear of turning into a refugee or being in the middle of a big disaster like Haiti or something.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I'm pretty sure I can ignore this. I mean, these thoughts still don't keep me from leaving the house. In fact, I've been able to for awhile. I guess right now, my problem is well, I don't know what the hell to do with my life, and I have to wait next semester for me to re-join my college.

4347,adhd,"I’m going to burn my house down I’ve been having a really hard time recently trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. 

I’m a 21 year old F, currently in university. 

My roommate is no long speaking to me because after two years of living with me, he’s decided he can’t fix me and has repeatedly called me “incompetent”. The last straw was me forgetting to turn the oven off last week and leaving the house with it on. 

This morning, I apparently left the water running in my bathroom and he told my friends about it and didn’t even mention it to me. 

I failed a class last semester because while I did the assignments, I forgot to turn in four of them to the online submission box. 

I’ve changed my major 4 times so far. Right now I have 3 jobs, and 4 (yes FOUR) internships (because I am truly excited about all of them and don’t want to give any up) plus I’m on our schools rowing team. I frequently make coffee at 9 pm because I feel like I can’t get any work done without (spoiler- I can’t get any work done anyway).

I’ve replaced my school ID four times because I’ve lost it. I have four deactivated debit cards that I’ve lost in my own house or car and then ordered a new one before I found it. I bought all this paint and wallpaper to redecorate my place last summer- it’s all still sitting in my closet and I painted only 3/4 walls in my room. My gpa is only 2.8. I’m late to everything and I HATE myself for it. One time I left my keys on the bus and couldn’t use my car for four days because of it. Another time I forgot where I parked my car in the airport and walked around for an hour. My car, my house, and my backpack are a disgusting whirlwind of chaos and I feel like I work my ass off to keep them clean. One time I didn’t pay my phone bill for so long I had to change my phone number because I put the bill UNDER MY RUG. The RUG??? 

Anyway everyone in my life is obviously frustrated with me and I’m frustrated with my self.  My mind is going 1000 miles per hour in class and I’m always on my laptop searching for a new project to start- often I’ll walk out wondering what the point was of going in the first place and I can barely read my own handwriting.

Most of the time, when I am talking with someone in a very general and casual conversation, i don't really have any issues with being able to figure out what i'm saying or want to say. However, when I begin to have a conversation on a more serious topic, I will immediately begin to shut down because I don't know how to formulate what i'm thinking and turn my thoughts into words.

All throughout my life, I literally cannot recall a time where I have been able to speak passionately about a subject and I really hate that about myself. I want to be able to connect with everyone that I talk to and not be embarrassed because I'm not sure how to keep the conversation going and not let it just die or hope that someone else chimes in.

Also, a common factor that a lot of people have with ADHD is that in their minds, they may have a thousand words per minute going but when it comes to speaking, they can only get one or two words out. I'm NOT like that ( I know there are multiple types of ADHD and that's not mine). To me, I feel that my mind is normally quiet. Someone may ask what i'm thinking and I am literally not thinking of anything. Like not a single thing is going through my mind, no images, no words, no ideas, NOTHING. I've been told it's a blessing but I whole-heartedly disagree. I want to be able to express emotion and be able to communicate normally.

Do any of you experience any of this? Serious replies only.

They approved of it but I never got it documented as it was all verbal and multiple people witnessed it. This is nothing new as I’ve done this the year prior.

Originally when i started, when my mind starts to wander, i tell myself to shift back to the breath and brushes the thought away kinda forcefully. As if i am ""cancelling"" the thought.

Now as i am getting used to each meditatiion session, when distractions starts to appear, i simply just acknowledge it is there, knowing it is there with my breath, then focusing back to my breath and slowly let the thought die as it deprives of my attention. I like to think of it as ""harmony in chaos"", dealing with the thought ""peacefully"" , continueing my focus on the breath while all the distractions and thoughts are there in the background, telling me to give them attention, but i do not give in.

Sure, I am depressed coming to that conclusion but I feel it’s something I’ve been denying about myself for a long time. Been at this thru my 20s and now that I am in my 30s, I have given up. Sure, I do have friends and family but they can only do so much. And the friends that are around are so busy with their families that they don't have time for me. I thought to myself that I deserve happiness. I want that feeling that I want to love someone and they love me back. I know its not right to look for happiness thru another person but I have so much love to give and not giving it to someone dealt a heavy blow to my ego. I’ve developed this disgust towards myself because I couldn’t blame other people for what they are looking for. I’d call myself a hypocrite since I do have a specific standard I am looking for or maybe I am putting too much high of a standard… I have been all of the popular dating apps, repeatedly rewriting profiles to “look” a certain way, change my appearance, and among many others things. I just can’t seem to catch a hint of attraction at all. I feel I have this repellant from other women that I am not datable and I am not blaming women for that. I think I am more of a friend than a lover to all. I need to re-invent myself again so I can move on from this.

5197,adhd,"Using ritalin more often to replace my antidepressants? I'm feeling really conflicted here...

 I have been diagnosed with ADD since I was about 7 I believe, and I have been using ritalin for (coincidentally) 7 years now. I also am depressed (yay) and taking medication for that 2.   
The antidepressants don't seem to be working even though I have been on them for about 6 months now, and they have been upping my dosage, but again no result.

A few days ago I went to see my psychiatrist who is in charge of my medication to check my blood pressure and heartrate since i'm on 90 mg ritalin a day now, and I'm also a big fan of coffee. Blood pressure was good, heartrate over 100 a minute which is not ideal. 

He asked me how I felt when I'm on ritalin, I told him I feel better than usual I guess.   
Then he asked me how do you feel when you're on your antidepressants? I told him I don't feel a difference (which duh it is not a instant effect type of med). His conclusion? Replace the antidepressants for ritalin. It makes you feel better, why not?

I feel like this is not a permenant solution, and also it doesn't account for the night hours when I'm at my worse (because depression). 

The point of this post is to see what other people think about this, and if they have any advice for me? Who knows.

I have had increasing tolerance over the past two years but it was manageable with tolerance breaks and IR doses of up to 40mg. About 12 weeks ago it stopped working, every time I took 20mg I felt EXHAUSTED, 40mg I would only focus for 1-2 hours and then crash, my heart rate would get into the 170s while sitting in a chair. I thought it was a change in brand, stuck it out for 2 months and switched brands but it still didn’t work, I struggled through increasing doses for another 2 weeks and then stopped taking it for a week and when I tried again, I felt okay for 2 days and then again felt horrible taking it. 

I am lost. Last week, I missed a very important exam because I just forgot to schedule it, I have turned in all of my assignments late and today, I tried taking 70mg and locking myself in the library and I sat there for 10 hours and didn’t finish what should have only taken me 2-3 hours. 

My plan is to stop taking it and to try my best to study without it, but I am terrified. This is the exact time I am supposed to hunkering down. 

Imposter syndrome is something real in medicine and I have never felt it until this afternoon. 

I have never truly doubted myself before now but I feel like I don’t deserve to be here, that I have taken away this spot from someone who can keep their shit together without relying on adderall. 

I am truly at my lowest and I could really use some help. 

Please, if you’ve been though something similar I would really appreciate your thoughts, How did you study when adderall stopped working? How were you able to reduce your tolerance? I have considered increasing the dose, using magnesium or trying an NMDA receptor antagonist but I am concerned about my heart rate. Is there another medication that I should consider switching to?

When you dream, your mind makes up stories about places and people. Places you may or may not have visited at all and faces of some people you knew but also of others you didn’t know. In your dreams, sometimes the stories can be so creative and elaborate.

All the time however, it didn’t require any input or effort from your own. It just happens effortlessly, even without you being conscious of it.

I'm 21, 5ft7, 60kg, study Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), and live in central London.

As far as my personality is concerned, my female friends have always said that I'm quite cute, charming, loving and affectionate, so I'm hoping that's your cup of tea! I have always been quite sociable and popular throughout life, but deep down, I am fairly shy and introverted. I'm quite fun and enjoyable to talk to, however, so I'm sure we'd get on just fine! :)

In terms of my interests, I thoroughly enjoy reading books on history and economics, as well as non-fiction and detective fiction. I also like discussing politics, following all kinds of sport (especially cricket, football, tennis, chess and badminton), playing the piano, listening to music (mainly EDM, classical and folk), watching documentaries and films (mainly comedy and romance), binge-watching YouTube videos, going for long walks, cuddling, and so much more...

I have been a chronic worrier throughout my life. Maybe not the worst who ever existed, but no matter what, my worries where always with me. They made bad times worse, and good times less enjoyable.

&amp;#x200B;

I still was able to develop, growing from pretty much social isolation during my teenage years to be able to push myself out of my comfort zone just a bit from time to time, allowing me to grow and to build confidence in myself, just a little, for the first time ever in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

With that confidence, I started to tell others about my issue with worrying. I felt like that it is good to just accept this to be part of me, that I am simply a chronic worrier. Telling others was probably my approach to at least share with my external world why I act how I act sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought this is the way to go, until I read a book in January of this year, which I stumbled upon googling once more about how to stop worrying so much.

&amp;#x200B;

That book opened my eyes. Condensed into one sentence:

&amp;#x200B;

Through this book I have learned that the right approach to deal with worries is not to accept that I am a worrier, but instead to accept the worries popping up in my head to be what they are - just thoughts.

It might sound too simple, but this book and the actionable steps it provides made a difference in my life after just a few weeks, that the years before combined would not sum up to.

19198,mindfulness,"Seeing purple blob during meditation I sometimes see the color purple while meditating. I am not sure if I am purposefully creating it or if it is a natural step. And if it is a step, what the next step is supposed to be.

Here’s my typical routine that gets me to that point:

-stretch
-sit or be comfortable
-(optional) set an intention
-grounding - zooming in and out and sending loving thoughts to the center of the earth and humanity
-body relaxation
-letting thoughts pass without attachment
-then, I frequently start to see the purple color at this point
-from here some thoughts come about what I should do in life currently and or in the future

Sometimes I see a color right away.

Anyone else have this and/or have any recommendations for what to do after?

I've been training mindfulness of and on for the past year now. I've been very busy with it the last 2 months and I feel like I have become very present but I still act on my impulses and my bad habits. Specifically binge eating and porn. These are things I've been wanting to stop with for quite some time now but I just can't seem to kick the habits. I am present and aware of what I'm doing at the moment but I still do it anyway. In some ways this makes it even worse cause I know what I'm doing is wrong.

Thought things were fine until I got home. The house was tidy, which I love, I ordered some takeout, lit some candles and decided to sit on the couch and put my feet up.

But it's not the typical anxiety when you have these  physical symptoms like racing heart and shakiness.

I have this and it's very frustrating. I can't do much about it because all the ""normal"" anxiety tips doesn't work on that kind of anxiety. I've tried distracting and mindfulness, exercise and everything but it has no effect on that feeling which is rather sadness, dullness, emptiness or maybe disappointed rather than actual anxiety.

This feeling comes usually (but not always) when my stimulant meds wears off. Like a comedown or a crash or something. So it's not ""all in my mind"" but there's really a concrete reason (dopamine going low too fast) to feeling that way and I can't change it just by thinking positive.

I’ve always gotten decent grades without studying and I used to always wing a test and tried to do that in year 10 however it wasn’t working, so I had to study however I CANT??? Every time I sit down to study, my mind wanders off and I just forget about studying. If I sit down and put 100% of my effort, it doesn’t pay off at all cause I won’t be able to retain the information. I simply don’t know how to study at all, I’ve barely done it before year 10 and during year 10 no study methods helped me at all and it’s really affecting my self confidence. I’ve gone from the decently smart person in class and to being close to flunking every test I set in just one year. My school is not aware of my disorder due to my parents not wanting to inform them as they aren’t very keen about it, however one teacher does know as he has figured out that I have ADHD as he used to teach people who had ADHD. I’ve lost all my motivation to study as I know ill always be near to flunking my test. My teachers are disappointed in me and constantly tell me off for losing focus, for not being organized and for ‘replying back’ as I’m also very impulsive, I’ve lost confidence in myself, my parents are disappointed in me compare me to my brother who’s extremely smart and always gets amazing grades.

I've had generalised anxiety for as long as I can remember, since being a small child, and it's grown as I've got older or during particularly difficult times. I definitely sense a feeling of prolonged stress at the moment, but I'm also a little confused. My anxiety in the past has consisted of panic, worry, dread, acute awareness of my problems and worries, incredibly strong adrenaline/butterflies feeling and sometimes lightheadedness.

This current bout started a few weeks ago, and it presented itself as something else I've suspected in the past - arrhythmia. My heart was jolting just before I was falling asleep, and also beating heavily at night time. I thought this was work anxiety and carried on but it got unbearable and I wasn't sleeping well. Then I started to have night sweats as well as the heart stuff, waking up soaking wet at least 5 times through the night. 

This has progressed to me being off work unable to cope with the idea and in a muddled sleep routine. Since being off work I haven't felt much of a let up in my anxiety, and have been having regular panic attacks mostly at night but now during the day too. I have also got a new symptom of throat tightness and feeling like my tongue and tonsils are closing. The first time I felt this I had a panic attack and ended up at A&amp;E demanding an ECG, to be told this is all anxiety. I had another ECG the following day and again was told it was clear. I just want to state I have been told once before after an ECG that I had an irregular heartbeat so this is something that I'm conscious of but never followed up. 

What I'm confused about is despite years and years of experience with anxiety and depression, these symptoms are so extreme and so.. new. Why now would my body be reacting this way? Are these symptoms as common as google makes them seem? Should I be worried about my throat or is this legitimately something that anxiety causes? Why could this time be so different to the others? Sorry that my post is long and waffly, I'm kinda in a panic state writing is and I don't know what I want to say, I just want to say it.

19626,mindfulness,"Mindfulness in relationships So I’ve been taking my mindfulness much more seriously and putting in more effort for a solid six+ months now. One area where I feel I need improvement is my new relationship. 

I’ve been dating a lady for about five months now. I absolutely adore her but she’s got some qualities that make it hard sometimes. She’s not the warmest, most affectionate person. Also, due to conflicting schedules and her living with currently living with an ex boyfriend (I know, seems like a red flag but I’m 100% there’s nothing still happening there) I can’t see her as often as I like. 

I understand that you can’t put your happiness in someone’s else’s hands but it’s hard to put that into practice. I catch myself hanging on text messages and getting upset if she isn’t good about texting back or things along those lines. I know that she likes me and she cares about me but it’s hard when it doesn’t feel 100% reciprocated. 

I’m just trying to focus on being happy no matter what. Even if she’s not texting me back as quick as I would like to try and stay grateful that she’s in my life. It just hurts because she doesn’t always want to see me (she’s got some health issues and doesn’t always want to be around people, which I try to understand and be supportive about). 

I’m seeing her later tonight and I’m going to tell her that I love her. It’s been on my mind constantly for like a month now and I’ve reflected a lot. I know she might not be the perfect person for me but I really think I love her. 

This is also the first real relationship in my adult life and I know that that has to color my judgement but I don’t care. It doesn’t matter why I feel like I do, I just know that it’s how I feel. I’m trying to get some clarity here but it’s not easy when I’m so busy with work and school. I look forward to hearing some different perspectives here.

It can be explained better like this: noticing mindwandering, gently redirecting attention to breathing/walking/driving/emotion/feeling, then letting go and wandering again (i would say 3 seconds of mindfulness). I know the mind's supposed to wander, but sometimes it makes me unhappy for the unrealistical expectations of daydreaming. The first month I didn't notice so much wandering, it seemed more present and aware. It's becoming a mental habit, like brushing teeth, like doing a new exercise in the gym for the first time, after a while it seems easier as you can use the right muscles to perform it more efficiently and now you are just maintaining it.

 I just sobbed and shook and went to his sisters house, she was acting supportive when I was there and always told me to come to her for bad anxiety bc “she gets it”. but when I left she said she thought I was making bf out to be a monster bc he wouldn’t help me with my anxiety “because he needed space” (her words)??  And I was being selfish and unhealthy? If he needed it why didn’t he just SAY SO. I didn’t know what he needed so I text bombed (not cool or ok I know and have profusely apologized just make it worse) begging to be told what was wrong and I hate myself for doing it. Absolutely fucking hate myself.

So yeah I was really happy for once in my life, felt loved and supported and really valued this boy and told him as much daily, and I ruined it. and now I’ve deleted all social media and stuff because his sister is picking apart every single thing I post (just songs or screenshots my pals saying good anxiety advice bc I’m trying to keep positive) and saying its about him and not to post about him. She keeps saying I’m making him out to be a monster and that genuinely confuses me so much. I love him. I think he’s the best. I just panicked with everything on my plate and he didn’t handle it well and neither did I.

But he wouldn’t even discuss it with me. He came over under the guise we’d talk about it and dumped me and left when he had said we would talk about lit. He hugged me and said he still wants to see me? But what I did made him feel like I thought he was emotionally abusive (?!?!) and he had to end this? I never ever have I thought or said that?! He looked so fucking sad. His best friend told me “you’re a good person and a good friend but your anxiety to blame here”

I’m so entirely devastated and I have wonderful friends who are incredibly kind and caring to me more than I deserve who won’t leave me by myself right now because they know that I’m not ok. Like suicidal thoughts. Hating myself. I just don’t know what to do. They keep telling me that he shouldn’t have started that convo via text and while I was overwhelming it was caring and not mean, and while I shouldn’t have done what I did he could’ve called anytime and fixed the situation but he didn’t. Its hard for me to think of it this way bc it feels entirely like my fault 

Last night my dumb ass made it even worse bc I got entirely shitfaced for the first time in months and asked him to please have an actual conversation with me and he just ignored me again. I’m in shock. He was so understanding when I told him I had anxiety and then he actually experienced me panicking worse than I had in years and he left

I deleted his number this morning so I’m not tempted to keep reaching out and fixing it and told him the balls in his court and we can talk whenever he’s ready and to take his time and take care of himself. I feel like his sister is making this even worse bc they’re close and she totally misunderstood my reasons for panicking somehow

I’m just really not okay. I can’t believe I fucked up so bad. I can’t turn back time and turn off my phone when I got anxious so I don’t know what the fuck to do. Thanks for reading if you got this far. I haven’t been this scared in a long time",anxiety,-kelsie,2019/01/20

17335,lonely,"15/F/USA 🍇 (A BIT LONG BUT WORTH IT)

for a few years now i’ve been dealing with major social anxiety. it really sucks but i’m not gonna sit here and complain about it because i know i’m not the only one. anyway, this might be long but it would mean a lot to me if at least one person read it all.

so when i was younger i moved to this new neighborhood and honestly i was really hoping people like me lived there because i didn’t have any friends initially (cause i did homeschool) so a few weeks after moving in there i was friends with kinda all the people my age and it was a really good feeling to have all these cool friends for like the first tome ever. until one day i got the news that i had to move to a whole different neighborhood AGAIN (i absolutely fuckin hated living at that new place) thankfully, i only ended up having to live there not long. so i guess kinda more “recently” i moved to yet another place (which ended up being permanent) and there used to be people i could hangout with if i wanted to but over time they moved before i even really got the chance to be friends with them. (they didn’t seem like people that would wanna be friends with me anyway) SOOO anyway, putting all of that aside, what really hurts me still to this day is how none of those people ended up keeping up with me. they never even check up on me. which is totally fine i guess but recently i’ve started realizing how truly lonely i am and i’ve developed extremely major social anxiety and depression. i just really miss having real human interaction with people... nowadays i just stay at home because i’m scared of crowds and having to talk to people face to face is scary. but it’s like every time i find someone cool in rl i wanna be friends with they literally act absolutely uninterested which could be cause of my awkwardness. who knows 🤷‍♀️ so since i’m too much of a wreck to have friends in the real world, i’ve decided to check this out one last time. maybe i’ll find someone who has the same problems i do? so if you wanna be friends, keep reading.

i’m honestly only looking for people who live in america and are willing to meet eventually i guess. (so serious friendships only 🤠) i’m a very clingy person and when people don’t reply fast enough i feel like i’ve done something wrong...  you’ve also gotta be down for voice calls sometimes and iMessage games 😍 the only important preferences are you’ve gotta be 15-17 and not extremely perverted. well i guess this was pretty much a vent or whatever. ok bye my annoying ass is leaving now 🤣✌️",lonely,umakemegouwu,2019/04/19

5102,adhd,"Husband just started Vyvanse....will he eventually calm down a bit? Title pretty much says it. He was switched from Ritalin 2x a day to 30mg Vyvanse about a week ago. 

Like many other stories I've read, he really likes how long it lasts, no crashes during mid-day, etc. He's also overweight and probably has some binge eating disorder characteristics, so the appetite suppression is something he's excited about. 

I am happy for him that this is working better than the Ritalin. However....he's acting super, um, meth-y, for lack of a better term. He left for an out of town trip with his buddies yesterday and spent a combined four hours cleaning the inside of his car Friday and Saturday. (It wasn't that dirty. On days I've driven his car, I've given my boss a lift in it and didn't think twice about it. But we're talking an exceptional detailing and probably doing some things twice.) 

That's really nice, but we have two little kids, a house that always needs cleaning, etc. It was something of an *issue* on Saturday that he was ultra-focused on his car versus helping with anything else. He's also relatively irritable and is monologuing a lot more than usual. 

They started him on the standard 30mg dose, and he's a big dude (250 lb or so). Is this normal, especially for someone who was already on Ritalin daily? Will it level out after a couple weeks of taking it, or does this sound like he might need a bit smaller dose?

Any insights/experiences are appreciated. I don't want to shit on a new med that he seems to really like, but if this continues, I'm gonna have to have a hard conversation with him about the tweaky tendencies he's developed since starting it.",adhd,poopshoes53,2019/07/01

A few days ago a classmate asked a question about graduation on Facebook and I answered. My classmate promptly deleted the question and therefore my response. With no feedback.

I get it now. My answers are unwanted and so am I. My loneliness and need for any acknowledgement has caused me to open my mouth out of turn and I have suffered for it.

I made a voodoo doll of that person by printing out their picture and stabbing it repeatedly over a few scotch pads. This I did after reflecting how coolly they have treated me; in the hallway, on assignments.

I am usually a very heartfelt sappy person, very easy to tears. But I am resolved. Sad things, sad movies, sob stories, are just there to pluck my heartstrings. I am determined not to shed a tear at graduation.

The past few days I have had a low ebbed heartache, not sorrowful, but rather dread. It's rather hard to sleep.

I will not smile, I will not grimace, I will not cry. To my professors I will give a professional thank you. For the rest, I will not make eye contact, I will not attempt to join any impromptu group; their families will be there anyway.

I've tried some mindfulness several times. Via occ health at work. And through chronic illness group who brought along mindfulness practitioners.

People suggest it to me a lot.

However I can't get along with it and really want to!  But they don't work with my body...

I can't breathe in fully.  It hurts to breathe. Therefore I can't do deep breaths in... I also cannot breathe through my nose at all.  I can't get into the sessions that mention this because I can't physically do what they're asking me to. So it ruins the flow and stops me from getting into the zone and getting anything out of it.

Then there's the types that talk of the body. Feel your feet press into the ground is okay if you're tall enough to sit in a chair and touch the ground with your feet. But I'm not. So I needed to slouch down in the chair to be able to feel my feet but then it just hurts my physical pains and is bad for my physio and posture etc. 

Lying down doesn't help either as the whole focus on feeling your back press into the bed just focuses on the pain I feel when I do.  So feel your back, makes me concentrate on the pain there.   Which pain management class teaches us to not do.  We were taught to not focus on the pain as this can actually make your pains worse.  I'm in pain all over so even if a mindfulness video didn't mention feel your back it mentions other body parts that all I feel is pain in.

So my dear mindful redditors... 😁

Does anyone here know of any mindfulness videos / apps that don't require *any* breathing (doesn't mention breathing) and doesn't have any feel your body sections?

As I feel these are my barriers to successfully being able to try mindfulness properly.

17221,lonely,"I hate these feelings My ex boyfriend likes to keep in contact with me. I was his first girlfriend and we were serious, so I guess he sees me as someone special, and wants to be my friend. We go to separate universities, he goes to a small private one and I go to a large public one.

I have an incredibly hard time finding close friends. There are so many people here and everyone sticks to their high school friends. I don't have close friends that I can just call up and ask if they want to hang out. No one asks me either. I just have people that I occasionally talk to through text. I spend almost every day alone. Meanwhile, the social environment is much more open where he is. I think within his first 2 weeks he already had an established close group of friends he talked to and hung out with all the time.

Not only do I hate the feeling of being alone (I constantly try and ask people to hang out with me but I rarely get a yes from anyone), but also the fact that sometimes I still miss him and remember he couldn't be happier with all his new friends regardless of my presence.

Over the years, my thoughts have taken on a life of their own, which is good, because I now have someone I can talk to.

I had so many adhd screw ups along the way, late assignments, a horrible time following all of the detailed instructions, you name it, but the biggest one was not completing an observation album. 

I just couldn’t figure out how to organize myself in enough time, and fear of failure and of having to reach out to strangers and ask favors just made me crawl into the proverbial hole and cover my head, hoping it would all magically work out. Ashamed, I didn’t reach out for help. I don’t know what I thought would happen, but it all paralyzed me. 

II graduated somehow, with really good marks, and if I do say so myself, really well made materials. But I didn’t get my diploma. This isn’t the screw up yet. 

I had a year to finish those observations, and I got a job teaching. I figured I was on track enough to finish on time, because I had a year. 

Except I didn’t. I was supposed to hand in my work on March 1st. It said it so clearly on the paper yet I somehow completely missed it. 

Now I have a new job that is dependent upon my finishing, and I don’t even know if they’ll accept my late album. The final due date is in August, but I was supposed to have handed it in in March, and I didn’t even know. 

Yesterday I was crying hysterically, sobbing to my mom on the phone and my boyfriend. I have such wonderful people who support me, but I am so tired of shooting myself in the foot. I am so tired of being in my own way. I work so hard and yet half the time I don’t even know what I’m forgetting until it’s too late. I’m ashamed of myself. I’m ashamed of losing my keys and phone all the time, of forgetting meetings, of zoning out in conversations and trying to not seem rude, of misplacing everything and being so messy, of not being able to keep track of emails, and deadlines. 

I’m ashamed that I can pass this whole training that is no easy feat with the highest marks in my whole cohort, and possibly fail because I can’t read a paper, and just get myself together enough to finish something for once. 

I don’t trust my brain, I don’t trust myself and I live in fear that I’m forgetting something big. And I keep proving myself right, because I’m always missing something.

Just looking for some insight into what its like growing up with ADHD if anyone is willing to share.

&amp;#x200B;

Background story, I have an 8 year old son, who was diagnosed with ADHD at 6 years old, we have been consulting with a specialist for the last 2 years who has now got him on medication that obviously changes and calms him during the day (lasts around 7 hours). Im not looking to discuss the medication side, just looking to try to understand what he goes through or some sort understanding of what his mind is doing when not on medication. I have read a few books, talked to a few doctors, but would like to get an understanding from actual people that have experienced it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to understand so i can help him structure his learning and life better, he doesnt really understand medically what it all means but if i can make it easier until he does i would like to.

&amp;#x200B;

Im struggling to get him to remember to eat lunch at school, and i would like to know what worked for you when you were growing up, maybe it was something simple like everything you owned was a colour to remember, any idea is helpful. Also struggle with outbursts of emotion, laughing on minute crying the next. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically looking for what worked for you when you were younger (outside of medication), thoughts you may want to pass onto a struggling father, to help me understand how to help.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read most of the wiki, and already do alot for him that is contained, but im not with him 24hrs a day, so want to develop strategies to help.. Sorry if this is not allowed, but couldnt find anything to say otherwise.

I was first prescribed 15mg of adderall once a day. At first, I could immediately tell the difference in my focus and how I would process information. However, that stopped significantly down after couple of weeks. I told my doctor about it not being super effective, and he prescribed me to take 15 mg of adderall twice a day. Even after taking the pill twice a day, I still felt like my attention span was really short, I often found  myself spacing out, and I was still really forgetful during work and school. This led me to stop taking the medication for about 3 weeks to see if I noticed a difference in my behavior. For the most part, I felt pretty much the same as I did with adderall, although I would occasionally forget small details at my work. 
   I started to take my medication again last week to see if I could notice anything different, but I still feel the same. I asked my family and boyfriend if they can tell the difference when I’m medicated or not. They told me that I respond faster when I’m on adderall, and it seems that I can hold longer conversations without switching  to non-related subjects. 
  I know I probably shouldn’t have handled my medication the way I did, but I still feel the same no matter what I do.

I have been diligently trying but can’t and the stress is making my focus worse which makes me more stressed and.. you get it.

Have decided to go back on meds and a revamp of some techniques to tackle the ADHD gremlins.

I've had a lot of problems staying motivated though, for several reasons.

1. My job requires me to multitask. A **lot**. And I'm not very good at it, so I have a tendency to get overwhelmed at times.
2. I've suffered from mild insomnia my entire life. I usually get about 5 hours of sleep at most, and never really wake up refreshed.

4. I'm a pragmatic old fart, and tend to get turned off by spirituality, especially ""woo"". I'm pretty much an atheist, even if (or perhaps because?) I was raised Roman Catholic.

Whenever I'm in a relationship, I get sick of the person I'm with about 6 months in. I have been with my current GF for about a year. She treats me great, she truly loves me, she is hot, etc. But I'm always looking at other peoples relationships and thinking that's what I want or looking at other people and thinking I would be happier with them. But I know what will happen is that I will just get with someone else and the exact same thing will happen again. I also go back and forth between wanting to leave the person I'm with and being afraid they will leave me throughout the entire relationship. I don't want to leave my current relationship, she truly loves me and I think that's worth a lot and I wouldn't want to hurt her. I know this isn't directly related to mindfulness, but I think this community could have some useful insight for me.

I've been getting into mindfulness and I understand that entertaining these thoughts so often might be why they keep popping up over and over.

I take Prozac and Wellbutrin currently which was doing the trick for a while but like all medications I’ve taken they lose their effectiveness regardless of dose and I just really need a doctor to crack my brain code because I hate this.

I don’t want to live in fear, man. Like, I can read statistics all day about the two things I’m freaking out about the most (roller coasters, next week and flying, in a couple months) but I can’t get over the fact that there’s still the chance that I’ll be a part of the statistic. As far as roller coasters go, it’s not even necessarily the fear of getting hurt/dying, but of getting stuck due to malfunction. It would be literal torture for me to be barred down in a tiny seat on a tiny track without any way to get down by myself. That’s kind of the deal with flying, too. 

There’s a ton in my head right now. I can’t find a good psychiatrist in my area. I’m nursing so experimenting with new medication is mostly off-limits. I would totally be addicted to benzos if I had access to them so those are a no go. 

I feel stuck, yeah? Like, I know there’s always help, but more and more it feels like actually getting the help is just SUCH a process and almost an impossibility. I’m not bad off enough for something like inpatient (my depression is part of the party too) but every day is a struggle.

16919,lonely,"Exhausting Dichotomy Some days, I hate being an introvert.

I want friends. I want a good conversation. I want romance and kisses in the dark and big hugs that come with being picked up and spun around. But, the interaction it takes to get there is exhausting. It's always so *taxing*. Laughing at the right jokes and finding particular subjects in common and constantly picking at someone's brain. I hate that it's so tiring. Because I want to be able to do it.

But, it's so exhausting.

I want to be able to be charismatic. I want to be able to find friends. I want to be able to stay up until 2 in the morning talking with someone and having laughs and creating memories and letting our fingertips roam.

But, it's so exhausting.

What I want is to crack jokes and laugh until I snort. But what I do is I stare at a blank television trying to decompress in the middle of the afternoon. What I want is to get dressed up and go out and have a good steak and a drink and giggle at jokes that are actually funny. But what I do is lay in bed yawning at 8 P.M. wishing my son would go to sleep so I can fall asleep, too. What I want is to cry on someone's shoulder and hear them whisper that things are going to be okay. And I want to be able to *believe* them.

But, it's just so damn exhausting.

I hate being an introvert. I hate being the quiet one. I hate that human interaction is so taxing on me because I miss human interaction so much.

It's an exhausting dichotomy, and I don't want to be this way anymore. I don't want to feel this way anymore.

7105,anxiety,"How do I deal with social anxiety? To start off with, I’m 18 years old and about to turn 19 and I’m a male. This is a long story so please bare with me. Also please don’t judge me. I feel like people in my spot are made fun of and this feels like the only place I can share this. 

Background: 
Growing up, I lived (and still do) in a very small town where there’s only one school and everyone knows each other. Let me say that this town is god awful. Everyone is so judgmental and hateful, girls in high school are usually getting pregnant, even one of the priests of a church was caught in an affair banging a married secretary. You wouldn’t believe this town unless you saw it. The police force don’t even care about drugs and its basically a Gomorrah. 

I have been abused physically and emotionally by my brother and dad my entire life. I’ve never really had any friends and I’ve never been good at anything or liked anything in particular. On the outside, we were the typical family who you would look at and admire. My parents took us to church every week (even though I hated it). Eventually, my dad was caught in a two year long affair and it ended with my mom divorcing him and he was so embarrassed that he had to leave the town, and I’m fine with that because he’s been terrible. Before all of this, I had a good outlook on life, I talked all the time and ate healthy. All of that changed around when I was 13-14 and that’s a another very long story. 

My anxiety: 
Now to the present, my life has completely changed and I’m an anti-social “shut in”. I’m never happy anymore, I never talk, and I have suicidal thoughts (but I don’t think I would harm myself yet). My emotions are always changing and I’m always 20% happy and 80% depressed. The anxiety and stress is so bad that I don’t leave my bedroom. At all. My hair is falling out from stress and my mental state is so fucked that I can’t even get up to take showers or brush my teeth, and I only eat once a day. I mostly sleep because my adrenaline is so low but when I’m awake, I’m constantly stressed and my mind is rambling. I’m not really scared of death anymore because if I did die, my problems would go away. My eyesight is also messing up badly and it’s only getting worse. My skin is so pale that if I do go outside (dentist or doctors) everyone will stare at me and usually think I’m sick. Everyone in my classes have all graduated and moved on from their lives while I’m stuck here and basically my own prisoner. I feel like the biggest loser on the earth. I try to get out. I really really do. Sometimes I even put on clothes and wait at the door but my anxiety gets so bad that I have trouble breathing and I literally have to sit down. I’m afraid if I keep going outside (doctors or whatever) I’m terrified that I will have a panic attack or a breakdown. I’ve never really had any friends and I’ve always felt useless because I was abused. My mind is also so scattered that I really don’t remember anything from my childhood exept a vactation, and my dad would always get off at five PM and that’s when my day would get even worse than it was. I did not have a good childhood and all the abuse and shitty things that happened, I believe is the cause of this. 

My remaining family have absolutely no idea about my stress and anxiety at all. I can’t tell them. They are EXTREMELY judgmental of everything and they think anxiety or depression is just an excuse and staying inside with stress makes you a loser, no exceptions. To make things worse, my grandfather shows up once a month and beats on my door just to scold me, basically a reminder that I’m a loser and I need to get my ass outside. I know! I fucking try! also he’s my my dad’s father so none of this surprises me. 

Now to the problem: 
Are there any books I can read? How can I get over social anxiety and my stress? Should I just suck it up and listen to my family and force myself to get my useless ass outside? If I do go outside, it doesn’t make anything better, in fact, my stress only gets worse. I hate talking to people and if I’m forced to be around someone, I just don’t talk and I stay quiet. If people come over, I lock the bedroom door so I can’t talk to anybody. I’m an introvert, I have no desire to get a job and I don’t have friends. The only time I’m ever happy is when the lights are off and I’m listening to music. My mom Is sick and I can’t stay like this forever. I’m just wasting away and watching my life pass, and it sucks. I feel like such a loser and it feels like I’m doing the world a favor by staying away from society. 

I feel like I can’t tell my family this at all. I also live in a very small town where everyone knows each other and they are judgmental, and there is absolutely nothing for me in this town, but I can’t move. My mom sick and my brother is always away partying or god knows what. I obviously need therapy, but I know there will be nothing done about it even if I do tell my family. I also have no one to take me to see a therapist if I could since our car doesn’t work and there’s no one to take me. Everyone we know have moved away exept the old people. If I would start going outside, I would never hear the end of it from my family since I’m going outside all the sudden. Even if good things happen to me, they will belittle me and shatter all of my confidence, even if I don’t tell them as long as they find out. They’ve always been very good at that. I just can’t stand them and there’s nowhere to go. They don’t understand that I’m sad all the time and they just think depression is an excuse. If it was up to me, I wouldn’t have any of these problems and I would be outside, friends or no friends. I want to die but I don’t have the guts to do it. I don’t believe in heaven or hell, but I’m scared that if i shoot myself, something will happen and I will live through it. 
Meanwhile my brother and his friends are the same as everyone else and they usually make fun of me. They call me ugly and say “make yourself useful and take a walk.” 

What I want: 
I want to be happy again and to have self esteem, where I can go outside anytime I want, where I don’t have stress. I want to be my own person and get a job so I can get money, then I can move and find another job. I just want to have my normal life back. I would finally like to start working out, and eat healthy. I want people to judge me and I won’t be insecure, to where I don’t care what anyone thinks about me. Right now, I don’t have any of these. I dropped out of high school and I’m not smart, so I want to get my GED and try to start college. My mom also doesn’t go out much since she’s sick. 

I’ve never been in a relationship before and I don’t care to be in one, I just need to focus on myself and try to be happy. 
I know what you might be thinking and no, I am not scared of the “outside world”. I never have been. That’s the whole point of my problem, I want to change and get outside. Apologies for the format and the constant rambling. Any advice will be appreciated. ",anxiety,Trusted-Marrow33,2019/02/23

My girlfriend, who I was convinced was the love of my life, took her own life almost a year ago now, she was the only girl to ever be my lover. After taking time to recover and straighten myself out, I began pursuing other relationships, and every time it was just some girl who pretended to be interested for attention, only to ghost me.

Well one day I thought my luck had turned around when my friend tells me that there's a girl who's interested in me, fast forward and we're starting to become a thing, we text often and she seems to be a different girl. One night I invited her over, we talked for hours and hours, before I motioned her to sit next to me. And to my surprise, she actually cuddled me. It might not sound like a lot, but I meant everything to me. That was possibly the happiest moment of my life when it happened, so I made the mistake of getting attached to her.

Fast forward a week or two and we're planning to go to the movies together, to spend some time on an actual date, I text her the night beforehand and ask her what she wants to go see, no response all night. Next day, text her, no response all day. Few days later I text her asking what went wrong between us. She replies that "" You're a really nice guy, but i'm not ready for a relationship yet""

Having ADHD kinda benefits me because I always have the mood to be happy even in the darkest moments in my life.

The job I am working at the people are very nice and supportive and it is on a contract basis. My superiors want me to get some courses in order for the possibility that at a later stage I can work ""permanently"" with them but the thing is.

My small son and I collected tiny pebbles from the lake shore. When we got home, we stacked them in all different areas of the house because it looked neat. A little stack in the kitchen, a little stack in the bathroom, a little stack on the nightstand. The little stack in the bathroom in particular kept getting knocked over and I noticed something. We were knocking over the stacks because we were not being mindful of our actions. I made the rule that if a stack was knocked over, that person would always have to take the time to restack it which was a little frustrating because they were such small stones. I told my son that if we had time to stack them each time, and we did, we had time to be mindful in the first place of our actions.

Over time, the stacks in our kitchen and bathroom started getting knocked over less, but when they did, it was a wonderful reminder that we could have been mindful of our actions in the first place. My son recently turned 18, and he told me that this practice has been very helpful to him throughout his life.

So I make videos for YouTube, specifically slow videos. I make them because my disability means I'm often unable to get out and about. On good days, I try to do a bunch of ""outside/nature"" stuff and get it on video, then I can watch them back on bad days. Sometimes it's just FPV of walking slowly down a trail, other times it's just sitting and looking at a nice view, with just the small movement of the wind in the clouds etc. On bad days it gives me something to focus on while I give myself time to just breathe and be. I started making them for me, but I'm starting to get messages from others saying they liked it, and how it's helped them too. I'd like to make more videos that help others out too :)

Anyway, I was wondering what things you would like to see of the outside on days you can't get there, regardless of why. Be it a busy day in the office, disability or illness (physical or mental), or life in general. To bring you a moment of stillness and peace, what do you like to look at?

4264,adhd,"Drugged with a pretty vague diagnosis, do I have ADHD or is my doctor just a jerk? To make this story as short as possible, I'm in my twenties, and was never diagnosed with ADHD. Four years ago I had a seizure and then a brain surgery. We thought the seizures would be gone after that, but they stuck around. And the medication I take for the seizures makes me SUPER spaced out. 

In order to manage grad school and a job when I've been having so much trouble focusing, my neurologist started me on a low dose of stimulants to combat how spacey I was on the seizure meds. I've tried a couple of different stimulants, very low dose, with varying degrees of success.

Well, this week I was discussing the side effects of the meds and the new treatment plan (strattera this time) and my doctor dropped a bombshell: he tells me, ""this is just you."" Meaning, he doesn't think my symptoms are a side effect of medication, he just thinks this is how my brain is. Is that an informal ADHD diagnosis? 

I always had certain symptoms as a child that had my mother jokingly refer to me every now and then as ""ADD child"" for being forgetful or easily distracted, and I tend to quickly jump on new projects and neglect old ones, and procrastinate terribly. But before the seizure meds, I never struggled with school work or concentration the way I do now.

Does that mean I've always had ADHD, and I'm just not managing as well now with the other medications slowing me down? Or are all the difficulties with concentration really just from my other meds, and my doctor's just kind of a jerk?",adhd,Happens2B,2019/07/17

Look at yourself and associate the person you are seeing in the mirror *paise and look all over yourself again* with these situations and positive, flattering, humbling experiences.
Then remember that that... is you.
Say it to yourself. 'All of that (feel the strong, comforting, warm heart that is acknowledging these qualities are truly good) is you.' (Look into your eyes and say it again)
'All of that is you.'

6917,anxiety,"Benefits of Spiritual Awakening for Successful Professional Life  Spirituality involves the attempt to seek one’s ultimate purpose in life, and spirituality in business involves developing a strong connection with oneself and one’s co-workers, having ideal beliefs and spiritual values. The spiritual values include values of work ethics, a good cause to work for the company, empowerment, and expression of emotion, which plays an important role in the employee’s life. Sometimes, spirituality is confused with religious tradition, but it does not involve a connection to any specific religion, rather it is based on the individual’s own personal values and philosophy. 

 **Daily morning spiritual practices** 

 **Time to connect spiritual source during work** 

 **Trashing out the negative thoughts**

18809,mindfulness,"I have issues with retaining focus with auditory distractions. Without going into much detail. I find myself easily distracted by sounds. I could be doing something and then hear a sound in the background and it instantly has the power to pull me away from my concentration, it leads to agitation and overall negative mood because my focus was broken, when that happens my mind is open to intrusive thoughts. 

Sound is weird because with all our other senses we have ways to tranquilize them in some way, Sound penetrates, but using earphones is not the fix, that's only a band aid. I want to be immune to the audio distractions that don't benefit me.

Background noise to others is a very foreground noise for me, others don't notice the sounds i do because it's insignificant data to most people, but to my mind, i harvest all sounds, think of my mind like a vacuum cleaner sucking it every single sound in reach. It's pretty exhausting at times, I'm a musician and i love music, so it's not sound that i dislike, i hate that my mind can't block out useless background noise. I know it's a problem because there's been so many times for example sitting with people, i hear a sound, for example a car horn, I'll make a comment like ""That was a weird horn"" and other people are like, what? what car horn.. or what? What do you mean bang? i didn't hear anything.. or what? Oh i didn't hear that plane fly over. It's normal insignificant noises that people subconsciously filter out because it's not beneficial in anyway, like big whooop a car just drove past, here i am sitting there and hear how the tires roll over the tarmac vividly. I just heard a door squeeze, my mind automatically renders the exact type of materials needed to create such a sound, i can see the object that made the sound with my ears. 

So hard to describe, if i put on earphones and block everything I'm fine, but i don't want to do this. 

I see the concept of mindfulness a way out, but i sit there just accepting the sounds bored out of my brain because I'm doing that every moment anyway.

Been struggling with OCD and anxiety symptoms for the last 10 or so years especially (I'm 22 years of age), and this latest obsession really is peculiar.

I have a pretty extreme anxiety reaction to the sound of my best friend's voice. He is my creative partner (we are in a music group together). First noticed that I didn't like the sound of his voice on the song recordings as I thought his voice didn't blend so well with mine (which is fair enough), but then whenever he would talk my mind started to obsess about whether I liked his voice or not, whether it's annoying, whether other find it annoying or not good or whatever. It directly coincided with a period of increased stress relating to our musical project, and I know it's my mind trying to protect me and diverting from issues that are actually important, but it just harms more. I have only talked to a few people about this, and of course have never talked to him about it as I don't want to hurt him or weird him out.

The worst part about it is the total shame and confusion. I'm sure most of you are familiar with the thought process of ""How the hell can this be troubling me so much, no one is going to understand, it's been going on for months and has taken lots of potential joy, I'm weird, something that is almost infinitely unimportant is going to ruin my life and my relationship with this person I love"". The shame makes things worse. But I trust that many of us have experienced obsessions about utterly nonsensical things, and the isolation when you feel you can't tell anyone. But as we also know, it's always a diversion from something important. However, this does necessarily make the intense pain go away or decrease in a meaningful way.

As I said, this is just the latest one, have had many different obsessions about 'very unimportant or small things ruining something important', and have normal talking therapy and tried out CBT. However, I see a lot of people talking about ERP (and sometimes ACT) here and have not tried that out. Would anyone here recommend it for what I have described?

Thank you very much if you have read this and I wish you all luck on your respective journeys!

**TL;DR** Have been experiencing OCD and anxiety about unimportant yet unavoidable part of very important person. Could ERP or ACT be helpful?",anxiety,tentativetaker,2019/08/01
17314,lonely,"How do I stop hating myself for not making myself a social life in college? I went to 3 different elementary schools (2 in TX, 1 in CA), 1 middle school (in CA - which was in the same school district as the CA elementary school), and 2 high schools (in NJ and MD). Overall, it somewhat makes sense I have no one I can communicate with on a regular basis - I only had a handful of distant friends I would see from family parties. In high school, I had \~5-6 classroom friends - I was invited to a birthday and graduation party, and had a small graduation party.

&amp;#x200B;

In CA, I made a good friend who I would email with on a regular basis throughout my high school years - when college started, she stopped contacting. After looking through her social media, it seems like she got ""wilder"" (i.e., go drinking, partying, wear heavy makeup, wear less conservative fashion, etc.) during college - so it might have been natural dwindling from her side. I reached out to her in sophomore year of college...but after one night of texting she never reached out again. I just looked over our email threads recently, and boy did I mess up - I think  a few times she didn't respond to my email...so for periods of time I wouldn't respond to her email for months if I felt the conversation ""ended"" - I should have waited a couple of weeks during the few times she didn't respond to my emails; still I am happy over our 4 years there was contact.

Flash forward to college - I believed the clubs/classes were cliquey throughout...but as I am about to graduate with my B.S. in electrical engineering this summer, I came up with an epiphany: it was my fault. Students follow the 4-year plan given to them by advisors - they can see the same people over and over again; whenever I listened to advisors (for 2 semesters) I failed classes so I invented my own schedules - I \*never\* failed classes when I made my own schedules (for 8 semesters).

&amp;#x200B;

I learned, after it was too late, that when it comes to making friends in college clubs you have to go to as many events as possible as a freshman, before cliques settle in; I should have done that in either my freshman or sophomore year of college (since it took me 5 years to graduate). Anyways, I was miserable over my college major (my parents said if I don't become an engineer I will never find a good job) so I spent majority of the time freaking out/procrastinating in my dorm/apartment and doing homework - if I could go back in time I would try to become more active in a religious organization or engineering sorority/organization. Even if I had 1-3 other friends to keep in touch with I would be fine; everyone has a million classroom friends, a million friends to hang out with, and a thriving social life after graduation - either by seeing high school/childhood friends by moving near their hometowns, or by moving near their college friends (I went to a major flagship state university, which is not terribly far from 2 major national cities).

&amp;#x200B;

After I repeated my 4th class in college (end of my 3rd year) I had a nervous breakdown over summer break - I talked to myself in my sleep, didn't eat for a few months, had a little bit of alopecia, and lost my period. My mom forced me to buy a circuit kit, and I reviewed my circuits course material over summer break

&amp;#x200B;

In college, I had only one friend who I would hang out with a few times a semester - turns out she doesn't have much of a social life in college either. She's special - I opened up to her about my father's passing in the middle of college, my dysfunctional family, and my current minor brush with the law; she opened up to me about finding it stressful to work and study full-time and become independent, her lack of college social life, her therapy visits, and her dysfunctional family. This is the first time I have \*ever\* found a friend I can trust with about anything. I would love to keep in touch with her...but I don't think it will happen - she is already stressed over working and trying to be independent, and she doesn't have a car yet and I don't drive on freeways yet - so we can't visit each other. However, went I sent her a FB message saying I appreciated her friendship since it was special and unique for me, she responded back that I was one of her closest friends in life.

&amp;#x200B;

In college, I made \~10-12 classroom friends (i.e., talk to each other in classes, do homework together, study for exams together, and send each other notes/files/assignments/exams from previous semesters) - irony is I made more of them after I repeated so many courses. There are a couple of girls who live in the same county as me, and we have invited each other to hang out very few times over 2-3 semesters (I could have seen them more if I was more active in my religious organization - I should have done that from the \*very\* start in either freshman or sophomore years) and we have carpooled together to/from campus - irony is I never would have had that if my father was still alive. Yes, I know religious organizations/engineering sororities are cliquey as well, but at least the people are less wild compared to other social clubs.

I could easily spend time cleaning up our house and helping my mom...but I am grumpy, lethargic and waste time seeing all these active social lives on Facebook, Instagram...even Venmo (as pathetic as it sounds).  After my summer online class ends this Saturday, I promised myself I would try to help out my mom more, maybe pick up some freeway driving lessons...and maybe visit the gym (to lose some weight) after my mom is pleased I am helping her out more. I hate how my high school and college assignments made me miserable - one side of the world revolved around getting decent grades, another side of the world revolved around everything else. In college, if I wasn't miserable over being invisible I was miserable over my college course work.

At social events (all throughout 23.5 years of my life), my mind either freezes up or intimate friendships/cliques have been already formed - it feels like no one cares about my existence - everyone follows around the bubbly/quirky/witty folks - I can never smile and converse unless my heart believes the other person likes me - the only ""good"" thing I bring to a friendship is a naturally peaceful aura if I believe someone likes me (I am not quirky/witty/bubbly - people have admitted to me I have a soothing/calming/peaceful presence - but who the hell ever wants that when there is fun?) - I don't know how to put myself out there; I hate that I discovered to late about putting myself out there more in college - half of me feels I was too scared it wouldn't work out so I just said ""screw this - try to pass your difficult classes in this major your parents said would set you up for life""; I still justify my behavior at times, genuinely believing it wouldn't have worked out either way. Half of me believes I didn't put myself out there in college since I was invisible in primary schools and family gatherings, half of me believes I didn't put myself out there because I hated my classes and overreacted over how hard they were. Now I will spend the rest of my life alone...just over ""What if I still failed and hated myself even more? What if I had only 1-2 successes?""

I still believe if people weren't social, I would felt better about myself and would not care about my lack of social life - with my father's recent passing (I watched him die from a massive cardiac arrest when I was 22 - I spent my last moments with him) I still am under my mom's roof (we all depended on my father for everything)...but hopefully I can become independent. College is the last place to form friendships, and I fucked that up due to various factors - cliques are universal everywhere. Half of me believes no one will miss me if I die, half of me believes I can distract myself by improving myself - that is easier than seeing a cliquish planet Earth, and bursting into tears since everyone values chatterboxes.

Please give me advice on how to love myself being a lone wolf - I hate wasting time on my phone, pigging out at home, laying around in bed, crying and screaming...and hearing my mom rightfully complain about running a household (I hope to become more active once I finish my bachelor's degree).

19073,mindfulness,"Struggling to Embded I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I thought I would give it a try and hopefully so of you could help impart your wisdom on me.

I've on/off suffered anxiety over the past 5 years or so and at the moment I'm really struggling around really just enjoying the present moment and the fact that I can't control anything. The worst it actually seems to get is on a weekend when I always feel I should be making the most of my time, yet instead if I have to do a menial task like shopping etc. I get anxious and stressed out because I feel like I should be doing something else. Or likewise if I know I've got free time I tend to struggle as I think well I should be reading xyz, I should be catching up on TV etc. I know this may seem trivial to some people yet I always feel like stressed out because of this, even though I know these aren't the most important things in life. Just being here is important and I need to learn to be able to embrace this, rather than always wanting to be doing something that I would call productive.

Just to give some background I've done different forms of meditation/mindfulness for a while, I used Headspace and decided that it wasn't for me as I found it a bit boring and repetitive. Despite each theme being different they all seemed to go back to the same exercises.

I've recently starting using Insight Timer and I love the variety on there and the 'best' I've felt for a long time was when I went through Mark Williams excellent book on trying to incorporate mindfulness into your life over an 8 week program. I've also read some of the books by Thich Nhat Hanh as well as The Power of Now by Echkart Tolle. At the time of reading them they had a big impact on me, yet I can't seem to get the practice embedded into my life in a consistent way, despite meditating daily.

Any thoughts/help/recommendations would be really appreciated and thanks for taking the time to read this as it's the first time I've had the nerve to type all of this out.

I assume this question gets asked a lot and if there is already a topic about it, feel free to guide me to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

A week ago, I picked up Eckhart Tolle's book 'The Power of Now.' Until then, I have avoided all sorts of 'self-help' books and Eastern philosophies. I read the book and at times I was really amazed. There were moments where I felt I was actually re-connecting with myself. I realized how I am basically never present. My mind goes on and on about the past and the future. 

I finished the book, started paying more attention to my thoughts and at times I became an observer. At those times, I could actually let go of the excessive/negative thinking. But after a few days I fell into a negative loop which ended up with me crying over my life situation, feeling very negative and I just felt like there has been no change whatsoever. I even started seeing the book in a negative light, having thoughts like 'it's a pseudo-science book and how could that ever change my thinking.' 

After a while, I calmed down and purely out of interest and I guess knowing somewhere deep in my heart that reading this book actually was helpful, I decided to go to the library and find another book to read in the same topic. I picked up 'The tao of inner peace' and once again I am very interested in what this book has to offer.   


But since there are a lot of ways to practice mindfulness - meditation, yoga, etc. Also I bet there are so many books to read. So my question is, is there a beginner's guide to mindfulness somewhere? Reading books is fine, but I want my journey to the enlightenment to be more directed.

4901,adhd,"I(M26) feel pretty broken. not sure what else to do at this point Lets break this down.

I'm 26 years old and in a place in my life with a TON of free time even though I'm trying to keep myself as busy as possible.

Lets list all my horrific problems shall we?

1) I'm religious (Which isn't a ""problem"" per say). I truly believe it but have a difficult time living it out. I live far away from the closest group to me that shares my faith and I have to travel quite a bit to get there. I overall feel like I complete failure in this part of my life which is ironic cause even the people who know my faults who are part of my faith group do not judge me or make me to feel bad. I'm much harder on myself than basically anyone Ive ever met.

2)I have all kinds of emotional issues. I'm hypersensitive though I typically do an ok job hiding it. I'm insecure, I think no one wants to be around me. Which is obviously not true cause its very common for me to hangout with friends 5+ times a week. If they didn't like me they wouldn't keep inviting me back. I'm a funny guy, i get people to laugh more than I use to (finally developed a sense of humor). But once I get back home its just all gone. All I'm left with is this empty feeling.

3) I want to have a close intimate relationship with a woman. Ive only ever had one girlfriend and it was a long distance relationship (We meet initially online, spent several years as friends, but then decided to be a couple and met in person). So I never really had a lot of physical contact. Its not even about sex for me, its the desire to feel known and loved, to have physical (and emotional) affection. Last time I got a hug was around 6 months ago.

4)I'm an addict. I have an addiction to what I'm going to call ""Lust"", but in a nutshell. When I feel tired and lonely I seek out porn and cybersex to make myself feel better. I just want to feel a connection with someone and so I seek it out. Its become compulsive and destroying my life to be honest. I'll stay up until 4am some nights trying to find someone only to collapse asleep when I can't and then try again the next day. Eventually I'll get through my binging, and try to stop the behavior but then its not to long till I'm back again. I hate myself even while I'm seeking it out. I just don't know how to stop because its the ONLY connection I really feel to other people. I feel like a woman is never going to want me (which objectively is false, thats an issue i'm working through in therapy). At least if I'm voice chatting with a woman online I feel something with someone. At least thats what i tell myself. I'm currently in a 12 step group for it.

5) I'm in a 12 step group, its an over an hour away from where I live, which is exhausting (living in the middle of nowhere sucks especially when you can't move for a few more years). I struggle to call my sponsor , i struggle to call other people and talk about my feelings and emotions. My whole life I was always told that my feelings were wrong, and truth be told many of them (Like the insecurities) ARE wrong. But constantly being told that and living with someone deeply manipulative fucked me up really good. The internet with it anonymity is the only place i feel safe to express myself in any way.

6) I'll never find what I want online. I straight up won't. What do I want? well thats easy. I want to find a woman around my age I can talk to with COMPLETE transparency (while still retaining anonymity). Someone I can explore the sexual stuff with who won't try to make me feel guilty but also won't try to keep me from feeling guilty either. Someone I can talk to and share stuff with right out of the gate without the bullshit and the games. Who has clear boundaries and clearly respects my boundaries.

I've tried mindfulness using Headspace or similarly guided meditations on and off for a few years as I suffer from major depression and anxiety. 

I always end up giving up after a few weeks as I notice no difference what so ever. I can never stop my mind wandering for more than a second or 2, thoughts just keep coming relentlessly. I really struggle with focus, keeping myself on track and constantly and am so easily distracted. I have a relentless bombardment of thoughts that never really lets up and which I could train my mind to change this.

I just keep ending up getting frustrated and disheartened that it's just not working. If I don't feel any benefits what is the point in doing it.

I've heard so many people say it has worked and been of great help for them so why do I get no benefit and why can't I master it, Am I doing something wrong? Am I just one of those people who it doesn't work for?

i think we were speaking the same  language when we first met. we made ourselves our little digital masks, our own colloquialisms and idioms. i found you through a mutual friend, completely on accident, and i waited on standby for you to answer me. 

you did, one day. you spoke, and i answered, and we began to realize we had an accent no one around us did. we left hints of our masks on the ground, bits of newspaper that fell off our papier mâché facades. 

you took your mask off first, showed me your face. i showed you mine. we were the same kind of soul, speaking the same language. maybe the dialect was different, maybe you knew slang that i didn't, maybe i was never fluent in anything, but we understood each other. snowflakes fell from my tongue and your voice was a blizzard. i found you in the heart of winter, and i showed you my storms just to hear you, just to feel your breath.

I have the script but haven’t filled it yet. Im scared to start taking them because of the side effects and the possibly difficulty in weaning off. He assured me it was a small dose and I would be fine. Im only 58kg, it could be a large dose for me.

4669,adhd,"Doctor doubts I have ADHD and should focus on alleviating depression. Idk Hi.

I'm Camille. New to Reddit and this is my first ever post on this site. Would just like to say how amazing this forum is as I've come across  so many countless threads and resources that I can relate to.

I'm in my mid twenties and believe I have ADHD (Inattentive). I've been clinically diagnosed with anxiety and depression but even during times I'm not particularly sad or depressed:

-I find it extremely hard to start tasks. I can procrastinate for weeks on something that will take me 15 minutes to do
-I'm chronically unorganised, untidy, all over the place, clumsy, constantly knocking things over
(however my mum is kinda the same so could be upbringing)
-Fired from every single job I've ever had, poor performance, taking too longs to do things because it would take me forever to psych myself up
-daydream too much making up scenarios that I play out in my head
-Find it difficult to concentrate and focus long periods of time

I'm currently on sertraline (zoloft SSRI) and its really helped with the depressive episodes.

My quality of life is shit poor cos I can't hold down a job, or manage my business, I can't hack doing the sales process and admin to the point I'm in the process of outsourcing everything.
I got fired from a job after 3 days once.

It could just be anxiety and depression because basically after being fired from my first job things went downhill so there's a lot of fear of failure and work related anxiety. I know in order to have ADHD you must have had it in childhood all I remember was that I was really bad at maths but good at creatuve subjects and all my teachers said I never lived up to my potential and saw scho as a social hub.

Ive been out of work for a while which has made me a lot worse but I'm currently in counselling on medication and changing careers to something a lot less profit and results driven which I think will help

My doctor says I should finish this course of medication start CBT and then we can look into a diagnosis because he says he doesn't want to get bogged down with all the diagnosis so it's more like a process of elimination which makes sense.

However speaking to girls and friends who have inattentive ADHD they said the ADD was the CAUSE of their depression and anxiety due to how bad your life can get because of it and once they started meds things improved for them almost I'mmediately.

I could go private but it's £300 in the UK for an assessment alone and I don't have that money atmo. Also I've been told it'd better to put that same amount into CBT. I Start CBT this year so hopefully that helps.

Would appreciate your insight. Do you think I should follow the doctors orders, what do you think of my situation? Literally would appreciate anything at this point.

Thank you.

As the title says, when I'm sick my meds masks the overall feeling of being ill which leads me to not realizing how sick I am. It also makes it difficult to tell when I'm actually getting better and when I'm not.

It happened a few times that I went to work out although I had a medium severe tonsillitis which of course made it waaay worse. I find this difficult to deal with. Especially since it's difficult to tell if I'm actually well or still weakened and vulnerable from illness.

Also I'm on a rather high dose of Concerta that quitting cold turkey from one day to the next would be a shock to the system. For that reason I shouldn't skip a day do see how I feel.

5141,adhd,"ADHD and Relationships. Advice? Hey guys, new to reddit and...honestly... never asked anyone for help mentally for a long list of reasons even I don't fully understand. So this is a weird idea for me, to be here typing this out for anyone in the world to see. 

I have been diagnosed with all kinds of stuff and over the years (I'm 24) I get different answers and solutions from any doctor I see. Granted, that's normal, and I've only seen 3 doctors about my mental health. My father overdosed off benzos when I was 16, and I found him while me and him were home alone. After a period of being numb I had post traumatic stress for years. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 11 or so and into my adulthood with experience and college and what not, I've found a lot of symptoms of depression were actually my ADHD.

Now to the point, my relationships go the same way every single time. I've had 5 relationships since I was 17. Meet, can't sleep thinking about her, relate everything I see to her, talk about marriage or even propose within 6 months, begin the disinterest slide, still love her even more than in the past but the ""old me"" is gone in her eyes, try to change, she gets tired of me being tired or acting disinterested in her, I leave or she leaves. 

I guess I center my minute to minute world around what is most interesting and engaging with me at the time, my relationship. My brain makes it like a challenge in the beginning, a game. How far can I get with this girl, not in a sexual way because that's easy, in an emotional way. That being said, when I meet a girl I'm fairly picky and immediately imagine the rest of my life with them everytime I obtain a new piece of information. This has brought me all over mentally, physically, and into so many new and amazing experiences. However every force in the universe has an equal and opposite effect. 

I thought depression was my ""thing."" That's it. Good Ole depression, slap some Prozac on it and we're good. One day my mother was talking to me and she had all kinds of mental issues as well and she said maybe I have ADHD. Didn't make sense because it's so hard for me to wake up in the morning, I'm always tired and exhausted, I'm disinterested in pretty much everything that isn't mentally challenging or engaging, and things of that sort. That's depression, that's not adhd.. right? ADHD is people running around all day doing 1 million things right? It's wake up, jump up, take care of life, rinse and repeat right? Well.. wrong. I got diagnosed and put on adderall. 2 drugs have been miracles for me in my life. Propranolol, and adderall. The former, is actually a blood pressure medicine I take for anxiety. Started off because me being a musician, my doc said it's what he's one for other musicians in town (Austin Texas) and they never complain. The latter is for, well, anxiety. I started taking it about 8 months into my current relationship. I love this girl. She has a ring, and for the first time in my life, so do I. Her parents like me, which is unusual because I'm covered in tattoos and have a back story that could be made into 10 different lifetime movies. She is almost the exact opposite which is where the title and this entire story leads to. 

I start adderall and after a few weeks I feel like I'm cured, while I'm ""on"" it. Little grumpy during the come downs but doc said it may happen. A couple times its got to the point I'm kinda sad at night because I'm me again, you know? The old me. I can't talk to her about ANY mental health issues because she doesn't understand them and tells me to stop taking this, or go on a walk, or wake up early everyday, and all these different things I've either tried, or know won't help. I drink, and she says that may be it also. Well I didn't start drinking or even liking alcohol until I tried whiskey when I was 22, and I was like this before. Recently, she straight took my adderal and said ""try to be without it for a few days"" and I said ""alright, easiest thing in my life."" I didn't go crazy or anything and I don't crave it like some people but now I'm back to old me. Tired all the time, impossible to wake up, disinterested in even the things I love, and I can't tell if she's happier or not. 

I guess the problem is she can't relate or understand, and subconsciously thinks I think she's dumb for offering these solutions. Either way I have issues and I think about how to solve this in my relationship but I look back and think.... this is every relationship... friendship... all of it. For me.

My doctor of 4+ years has just moved into a practice after working solo. He informed me a few months ago of the move and I had decided to stay with him at his new location. I pick up my Rx for Adderall every month with no problem. I am due to pick up my Rx now and called his new office. The medical assistant informed me that she thinks I will need an appointment to ""get into their system"" before I can pick up Rx. She also told me he wasn't taking appointments until next week. His first day at his new location per him was yesterday. My impression from talking to the medical assistant was that she had not spoken to my doctor directly. Unfortunately, I no longer have a way to contact him directly as I have in the past. He did not tell me that any of this would be necessary in order to pick up my next Rx.

I'm very upset and frustrated at this situation. I am due for my Rx at this point and will now be out for several days until I can schedule an appointment with him which I don't even need. 

I am ready to find another doctor but am very intimidated to do so. I don't like having to justify needing it and have had several doctors tell me they don't prescribe it. 

My current doctor is an internal medicine specialist. Having worked in a pharmacy in the past I know that many different types of doctors prescribe adhd medication but I have not had much luck. 

Any advice on this situation? Is it fair to make me wait and schedule an appointment for medication that I am due for?

19508,mindfulness,"Devil’s advocate: The only thing we have control over is our expression. Life is fucking chaos. Everything is misaligned. We say we want one thing and should be somewhere but are in a completely different direction.

A lot of modern rhetoric says that we have control over how we choose to react to things that happen around us. “Mindfulness!” They say. “Feel how you feel without judging your emotions!”

This is the crux. If you have no internal fire responding to how you react to things, you are suppressing your emotions. Internally, we are beings that despise change, yet that is the only “constant in life.” We’re not meant to embrace change. We’re meant to hate it.

And yet, this is the very fire that screams within us. This is the seed of true expression. It’s not about trying to be stoic to how you feel, but it’s within really reaching in your true emotions and expressing it.

Point is, we’re not meant to be “peaceful” rocks, still and unmoving. Movement is the only constant, right?

Furthermore, life is not about “trying” to attain more awareness so you can sit within the clouds. Look, if you’re attached to things, that’s always gonna be the case unless life needs you to change. It’s not about purposely pushing things away to try to attain enlightenment, because that in itself is attachment.

2. I would experience hallucinations. Very vivid hallucinations. Usually spiders in full detail to the point it was 100% lifelike in my mind yo the point it was indistinguishable from reality.But alo then the usual hallucinations of colours, visual snow and people etc.

3. I would also experience very unsettling mental thoughts constantly. One being the constant image that my brain was made of teeth (?). I have no idea. But i remember it to this day and it makes me feel sick. This 1 just one of many but you get the picture.

I feel like I’m failing all the time even though I have lots of people to help me and support me.

I emailed the professor with a letter from school about my anxiety so hopefully he will understand.

My relationship with mediation seems to be very similar to many others here: I often have trouble focusing, and staying consistent with the practice is difficult.

I’ve fallen out of meditating in the last few months and will be getting back into it with the new year. As a goal I’m wanting to try and eliminate phyisical ticks that I’ve carried around for most of my life. I don’t have any diagnosed medical explanation for the ticks, it seems to just be something I’ve always done as a compulsion: tightening certain muscles, taking irregular breaths, holding my breath at random times, purposefully blinking with slight irregularity. I’ll often notice I’m doing one of these and have been doing it for the past 10 or 20 minutes. It makes it where my body always feels tense and I suspect it’s physically making me more tired on a daily basis. Ultimately, I’m wanting to get in touch with my body more so I can hopefully eliminate this (along with other benefits of mindfulness.

So a little background, I'm the type of person that overthinks a lot, ideas, concepts, people etc.

Now I know this isn't healthy and I am more mindful and observing of my thoughts and made certain realizations regarding this.

But I am confused or struggle, I don't know which one, with something. 

Mindfulness or Spirituality in general teaches that you have to observe your mind in order for thoughts to no longer influence you or not be there anymore unless needed.

What I'm confused about is the following: I am observing my thoughts and they do have a lesser grip on me than they used to but at the same time they do not seem to occur less, I still have a lot of thoughts.

I will try to make it a bit clearer with an example and what made me to make this post. This morning on my way to work I had a lot of thoughts, negative thoughts mostly, ruined my mood and everything. I tried to observe them but I was already frustrated and that made it harder and I guess I was also resisting them. But then I just allowed them to pour while just observing them and everything went away afterwards, peace came and I was free of thought for a while.

This is what confuses me the most, is this what I should always do ? I should just allow thoughts even if they are negative or extremely negative flow though my head and just observe them ?

I think I am resisting negative thoughts, then they pile inside of me for not allowing them to get to the surface, instead of just observing them as they come and making peace with it.",mindfulness,Herazim,2018/12/18
19436,mindfulness,"Anxiety about how to spend time when not facing a screen? Amateur here
I’ve been gradually seeking/striving for mindfulness and meaning over this past year. I over-think so I meditate(have not noticed any life-altering sessions except ending with a clearer mind). I have a responsibility to my health so I stopped eating terribly and started going to the gym. I have now lost over 60lbs so far. I have a responsibility of education so I read (mostly non fiction/philosophical/self help. Trying to expand my horizons now into fiction as I’ve never been an avid reader or a great student after I realized the minimum I could do to get by)
Now I’m at a point where I’ve realized that outside of these activities I have nothing, so the remainder of the time I’m glued to a screen and there’s an anxiety about letting go of these.
What do I do with my time
How do I spend it the best way possible
Let me look online for something to do so I don’t just waste time sitting/laying or doing something pointless
Gets hooked into social media
Autopilot

It’s ironic but ultimately this is what happens and I’m disheartened by it as I’ve always preferred less technology. I was the kind of kid that told my parents I didn’t need a smart phone. As an adult now, I realize how backwards my life has come since the ways I preferred to live. Is this growth or chaos?
I want to take the leap and let go
I’m trying to find a hobby, but that in itself is ironic. 
Social media-manipulates our sense of necessity. We crave/“need” to live a certain way or look a certain way to achieve certain things and the sight of people we are familiar with having these creates conflict in us and how we spend our time.
I seek to limit/eliminate social media now but it’s effects still prevail as I don’t know how to achieve the things social media has primed me to want. 
I want to change what I want but the anxiety of the time I have alone keeps me from truly finding what is genuine and meaningful to me.
You get the point. It’s a thought cycle. Plainly, being more mindful than I once was, I feel like I’ve forgotten how to simply “play”. Everything feels like a burden of weighing out pros and cons. How does it improve me? It was easier to lose weight as it was a direct health issue.

After severe daily panic attacks multiple times a day over the summer, specifically regarding things going on with my body, and going to the ER because of it, I finally went to seek help for my anxiety in general. I scheduled an appointment with my GP, who was very supportive (started me off with 25 mg Zoloft and referred me to mental health services within the clinic), and subsequently with a psychologist (I see them every week) and psychiatrist (who I agreed with to up my dose to 50 mg which just started recently, so we'll see how that goes, I'm just nervous about antidepressants in general I guess). 

Over a period of about two months, I haven't had any negative thoughts about my health. Well, at least in regards to ""oh my god am I having a stroke/heart attack/aneurysm right now am I gonna die"", like I don't think I'm in any mortal danger.

7071,anxiety,"A rant/vent, from the top of my head to yours The first time I realised that my anxiety had a large impracticality on my life was during year 13, 6th form when I dropped out of the class I was performing best in simply because of the fact that I didn’t have the heart to tell my head of 6th form that she had forgotten to sign me up for the class formally. I later realised looking backwards that the meeting focused on my performance in school that I would rather take the quick fix and tell her that I dropped out due to worries of my grades rather than telling her that she had made a simple mistake in her reentrance from maternity and not signed me up for this. This signalled a start into a spiral of quick fixes, which went from realising that drinking is sometimes ok to getting sent to hospital for being on incredible amounts of Xanax ( over 50mg at once whilst found) and becoming physically dependent on oxycodone after realising so when I went on a holiday where I did not have the connection to get some more and couldn’t leave bed after a day of Xanax to cope with the withdrawal symptoms. It has taken 3 drug related hospital trips and a year of suicidal thoughts to realise that I could be suffering from anxiety.

 I grew up only ever having a very small group of friends, one of which I was always obsessed of, and having no father who had skilled himself due to his own anxiety and the depression.  In hindsight these were huge red flags for future mental health problems. My mother was obsessed with spoiling me with material possessions because of her own poverty and missed opportunities due to money problems and missed these however.

After 18 years of suffering from anxiety I am finally realising that I indeed have a problem and am not simply acting childish. I am writing this post with hopes that I can now realise that discussing my mental health is a good thing instead of letting it fester in my own mind, and the drugs it relies on for days on end. And with hopes that it leads to a better future for me, and those who’ve stuck with me through, the multiple near death experiences I’ve brought upon myself.

This weekend I realized I have a problem.

I have always felt a bit numb to others emotions and troubles probably because of how I was raised. Abused by my father and just a rocky upbringing overall. Since I was a kid I never felt too emotionally attached to anyone, not even my parents past the age of about 13.

I will say “oh my god I’m so sorry to hear that” only because it’s what I hear on tv and in public but I will admit that most of the time I think “well that sucks but it isn’t me”.

I like to think I’m a selfless person but I think I’m just selfish. I’m very kind and friendly to others and go out of my way to help people because it feels good but at the end of the day I think I really just care about myself.

Well this weekend my sister’s boyfriend was in a tragic car accident with her daughter, my niece (1 year old).

It was an absolutely horrible accident and he passed away but my niece survived with no injuries. 

I read the text from my mom and cried for like 10 seconds out of shock, then went completely numb as I usually do and continued cleaning up at work while keeping the thought in my mind wondering why I wasn’t feeling devastated. I was sad that it happened but was easily able to just shrug it off knowing my niece was okay. Even though I knew my sister would be and is absolutely devastated I cannot FEEL too much empathy for her and I don’t know why.

This is clearly a problem and now that a few days have passed of me trying to emotionally comfort my sister I realize I have a huge fucking problem.

I am 23 and I am struggling with balancing the benefits and problems with smartphones/computers and my screen time. 

I don’t have social media (unless reddit counts) since May. I work with computers all day (data analyst). More and more, even though I’ve gotten rid of social media, I find myself constantly looking at my phone, ignoring the work I have to do and the world around me. I even find myself looking at my phone to read things when I’m walking sometimes. I’ve basically trained myself to open up something productive on my computer and then look at my phone and do something unproductive. 

So besides getting rid of social media, i frequently delete unproductive apps like reddit from my phone, turn my data off, I use the screen time app to try to dissuade me from using specific apps and yet I always find myself undoing these actions so I can get that reddit dopamine rush. Sometimes I do this when I’m doing something else otherwise fun, like hanging out with my boyfriend. 

HOWEVER, I am afraid of doing something drastic (like getting rid of my data completely) for a few reasons. 
1) social - I’m 23, everybody communicates via texting apps like whatsapp and discord and iMessage. If I got rid of data it would make it even harder for me to maintain my friendships (which is already a bit hard since I stopped drinking and got rid of my social media, which my friends still partake in a lot). This is my main fear, that I will compromise my friendships by just being too hard to get ahold of. 

2) thé usefulness of so many apps. I use my phone a lot, and a decent amount of it is for useful things. I track my moods, I have a CBT app, I have a meditation app and a fasting app and apps to help me learn French and remember to water my plants, and Instacart for groceries, uber, bus tracking apps, maps apps etc. I don’t want to forgo the usefulness of these, especially the bus tracking apps and maps. I live in Canada and if you’re waiting for the bus in the middle of nowhere in the winter, having data and uber can be a real life saver if the bus doesn’t come. 

So I guess, I’m aware of all of the problems associated with my phone but also of the costs that would come with getting rid of data. I guess the ideal thing would be to improve my self control with my phone so I can still have the data without feeling like I’m addicted ri the screen. 

Does anybody have any advice for what to do here, or what worked for you?? I just want to live in the moment and look at real things and not my phone and it’s so hard.",mindfulness,4896girl,2019/10/08

I’m a 24 year old female, been on Lexapro 20mg &amp; Klonopin .5 mg for depression, anxiety with PTSD for over a year after an AWFUL period of being on Zoloft. About 2 months ago I was diagnosed with ADHD (attention) from another Dr. that I switched to as my other wasn’t qualified for ADHD testing &amp; I was put on Ritalin 10mg twice a day. It helped me in so many ways. I even got kind of emotional because I really thought I was just flat out stupid my whole life. I focused on ONE thing &amp; could actually talk &amp; work with confidence (I’m a optometric assistant tech.) I began coming to work on time after being warned about termination if I kept being late. I went to bed on time &amp; woke up early and ready for my day. I was able to keep my house clean and organized. My life just all around was finally looking up after many years of struggles. A couple weeks ago I let my Dr know the IR wears off quickly but helps perfectly, so he put me on a generic Concerta ER 10 mg in the morning &amp; Ritalin IR 20 mg in the afternoon. I hate it. I am back to my mind being cluttered, headaches, virtually no appetite, no motivation &amp; NO SLEEP. Which is making me cranky &amp; late to work again &amp; pissed off. But the 20 mg of Ritalin IR helps amazingly. I’ve tried a day without the ER all together and just my IR &amp; it is great. I’m new to this so I don’t know how the process works.. Is this normal? Does anyone else have this issue with ER? Does it take a while to get a good combo down? What’s anyone else’s combo?  I’ve done research on a lot of the meds but it’s a lot of info to take in.

19240,mindfulness,"Thoughts on ""tainted"" practice and obsessing over results. Not trying to be contrarian, but I don't think it's a great idea to post certain idealistic things I often see upvoted in here and in r/meditation.

Of course I'm glad if someone who was depressed or anxious, or even just excited and new to this way of life wants to share. I’m not trying to say it’s “bad” to post stuff like that, and sometimes it’s definitely good because you could argue that it gets more people interested who don’t practice meditation/mindfulness. Great. But it may be unskillful. 

Let’s not kid ourselves. If you’ve struggled with difficult emotions (or lack of ANY emotions with depression), guess what? They’re going to come back. I’m not saying this to be pessimistic, I’m saying this because if you look at your life in a general way, you know that these things are like seasons or waves and that they do come around again. Same with happiness. I worry that idealistic postings raving on and on about the benefits of meditation/mindfulness can implant false impressions for our attitudes and practice. 

Everything I’ve said may seem obvious on an intellectual level, but that’s only half the story. Thoughts are intellectual AND filled with emotional content—like how physical objects have shapes AND color. So it’s easy to say “yeah, yeah, yeah Dharmaforkarma, I’ve read some books by Eckhart Tolle and studied some Theravada Buddhism, so I know all that.” And I KNOW you guys know, but I implore you to ALSO remember that your emotions are always going on in the background and they’re very slippery. 

Most people that are reading this know all about how facebook and social media are bad. The superficiality is like eating all the grains in your Lucky Charms privately and then taking a pic of your marshmellows and saying, “Hey, this is my life!” And then the fear of missing out. I’m on my couch playing Resident Evil 2 and if I still had fb I’m sure I could have looked on it and seen my friends at their Super Bowl party. (Although honestly, I’m like 99% sure I had a better time lol.)

Ok, again, we all know these pitfalls. As a society we’re slowly developing antibodies to this stuff. Maybe in 30 years we’ll look at excessive social media the way we look back now at how common smoking once was or how harmful trans fats were before we knew better. 

But there are other slightly more insidious pitfalls as well. Facebook and social media have made it so that a lot of the time we take chunks of our lives and we turn them into STORIES. We turn them into NARRATIVES. When we do this again and again, and when we SEE other people doing this again and again, it conditions our brains to going from merely experiencing things naturally to tying up experiences with neat little bowties and excessively categorizing them: Good experience, NOW I’m happy, this is BAD, I’m cold, things will be good when X happens, things will be good if Y doesn’t happen, I’m not good enough because this thing I tried to do failed, etc. 

When our minds become programmed to write and identify with these stories, it’s the cognitive equivalent of seeing something through your phone’s camera rather than seeing it directly with your eyes. We’re recording—we’re CLINGING to something instead of just letting ourselves live it. And then what happens? The happiness fades like summer warmth and we’re right back to where we started, or worse, we’re worse off because of the disappointment. 

This condition is basically what’s meant by dualism in the context of dharmic thought. It’s that itch you can never quite scratch. That proverbial dangling carrot the horse never gets to taste. That psychological tinnitus of excessive, anxious thinking: I have to meet someone, I have to meet someone I’m actually happy with, I have to get that degree, I have to pay off my student loans, I have to get a promotion, I have to get a job I actually find meaningful…you get that idea!

Our entire culture here in America and elsewhere is, at its core, wholly antithetical to mindfulness. It feeds our dualism and the resulting suffering endlessly with commercials that feature touching dramas to sell you stuff, with parents pressuring us to get married or have kids, with video games to go hunting on and on for achievements, with our GPA, the career ladder….I’m starting to sound like a broken record but it’s important. It’s not just enough to know this intellectually. None of these things are BAD mind you, it’s just that they can be a trap if you don’t navigate through them MINDFULLY. That’s what this is largely about.

Consider the following koan: 

Monk: In order to work in the Tao is there a special way?

Master: Yes, there is one.

Monk: Which is it?

Master: When one is hungry, he eats, when one is tired, he sleeps.

Monk: That is what everybody does; is their way then the same as yours?

Master: It is not the same.

Monk: Why not? 

Master: When they eat they do not only eat, they weave all sort of imaginings. When they sleep they do not only sleep, they give free rein to a thousand idle thoughts. This is why their way is not my way.        

So having said all that and written this laborious essay, let me go back to my original point: When people on this very forum enthusiastically post about a progress report or a happy moment in their lives only to be showered with upvotes, a part of me can’t help but judgmentally wonder if there’s some clinging going on there. It looks an awful lot like the rat-race/dualistic mindset I’ve been trying to outline. It should give us all pause: our meditation/mindfulness practice ITSELF can be tainted with some extra longing and clinging. It’s worth thinking about.

18728,mindfulness,"[practice] Reality Based Evaluation of Meditation Experience &amp;#x200B;

I would like to start a conversation about being able to evaluate meditation experience without using ""maps"". In the discussions that appear in forums, in books written by people that claim to have high achievements, and among students, there is an attempt to count and qualify the levels of experience. This was an area reserved for all knowing teachers that would judge the achievements of students and put a seal on their attainments. In the modern schools without hierarchy it seems that this has changed.

My personal bias is that any experience that doesn't serve to make life better, in us and among us, serves no purpose. It doesn't matter how flashy or interesting it may be or what it says about the functioning of the brain or consciousness. After all, isn't the end of suffering the real goal. But, even for those that have an interest in exploring the far reaches, what I am proposing will help immensely.

***What I propose is to learn and apply an interview technique that can be used by teachers and students to help other practitioners clarify and verbalize the actual experience had while meditating.*** The technique is the "" Explicitation Interview Method"" created by Pierre Vermersch in the 1980""s and used by Clair Petitmengin as the""micro-phenomenological interview"" in the present. Petitmengin has already done studies with meditators successfully.(1) The results were surprising even for meditators with 40 years experience who were able to access experience they had not realized they had. The aim of the technique is to keep the person interviewed focused on the experience without digressing to explanations or elaborations. An example of this can be seen at [https://www.microphenomenology.com/home](https://www.microphenomenology.com/home) in the video ""Elephants"".

The concept of fellow practitioners helping others to deepen their understanding is not new. The technique developed by Gene Gendling ""Focusing"" is similar in that it helps people guide others to an understanding of the ""felt sense"" in the body. Developing a method for guiding meditators to understand and consolidate their experiences will allow a steady and solid progression of practice. It will eliminate the waste of time on experiences that are wonderful and exhilarating but are not ""workable"", that provide no benefits in waking up or in growing up. This idea will have to be elaborated perhaps by people with more expertise than I. If learning and teaching meditation is to become a permanent part of culture something along this line will have to be developed.

17373,lonely,"Musings #2 | November 24, 2018 It's 2:30 in the morning and yet I feel the need to write this.

I peaked at twelve years old.

Nothing in my life, if it continues to go the same as it seems it will from now on.

Nothing will ever compare to the thrill of victory I felt at that moment, against all odds, after soundly destroying the competition.

I can't say what exactly I'm referring to for the sake of my own privacy. But it was a fairly major regional event, especially in the circles I was in at the time.

What have I done in the four years since then? Learned, studied incredibly hard, and most of all, lost friends and wasted my teenage years which I won't get back.

Maybe it will pay off, maybe it won't. But who fucking cares? I've wasted four years of my life on school and I'm no further forward emotionally. I've never had a girlfriend, never even kissed a girl, never done anything remotely interesting in the last four years that I can look back on and say, ""This mattered.""

I don't know how to drive, I don't know how to cook, I don't know how to pay taxes. I am in no position to be an adult even though that time is not long away. But I can tell you about transcendentalism or integration by partial fractions or the Poisson distribution. Who gives a shit???

Today I got to relive that day where I peaked a bit and it made me fired up. I'm going to try to do it again. I don't have the resources I did last time. But fuck it, no one's gonna stop me.

But I'm just so damn lonely. I wish I had someone to hold me and me to hold her as we mutually reassured each other about life. It's going to be ok. It's going to be ok. I swear it's going to be ok.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to share my experience with this because just a couple of years ago I was crippled with driving anxiety. Note that I am just a regular person, not a doctor, so take my experience as what it is: a personal experience. 

Background: I am a 30 year old female. Ten years ago I began having panic attacks. My anxiety is worse in open areas and social situations. For example, an open field, Costco or a shopping mall were nightmare experiences for me. Somehow this started to creep into driving. I think that my social anxiety is what affected my driving. I would become very nervous if someone was behind me or if I had a left turn and I was at the front of the line. That ""nervousness"" grew like an untreated infection until I became absolutely terrified of driving. I became a recluse. Some days I was honestly too frightened to go to the mailbox. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I became so anxious that I could not drive anywhere.** I moved in with a family member and felt absolutely trapped. Even the thought of driving just down the road filled me with terror. I thought I would never be independent again.

I used to scour the internet for stories of folks who overcame this terrible anxiety, so I would like to share my story in case it could help others. 

&amp;#x200B;

**These are the steps I took to overcome my fear.**

&amp;#x200B;

1. I accepted my fear. I truly think that the moment you accept your anxiety, it starts to lose its power over you. I thought to myself, ""If I panic, I am not going to fight it. I'm going to let it pass and tell myself that this is a temporary concern."" I realized that the more I fight a panic attack, the worse it seems to be. I just had to accept it and let it pour over me. It will end. It is not forever. You will come out on the other side.
2. I drove about a mile down the road and back. A mile might seem like nothing, but to me it was EVERYTHING. I was shaking the entire time. Despite my fear, it was important for me to pump myself up and talk positively to myself. Which brings me to 
3. I rewarded myself. That mile and back was an accomplishment! I did it! I literally cheered for myself the entire way home. Don't feel silly for talking to yourself in a positive way. I don't have much encouragement otherwise from family or friends (it's so hard for others to understand anxiety) so those words of encouragement from myself were so important. ""You are a badass! Look at you go! You are amazing!"" It's crucial to end the driving experience on a good note. Try to be proud of yourself. You overcame something great!
4. I set new challenges for myself. After driving a mile and back a few times, I decided to try driving to the grocery store (which is about two miles away). Then I drove to the store and bought a few things. Then I drove a little bit further. I kept setting new goals until finally I was driving out of the city to visit family members living hours away!

&amp;#x200B;

If I could give one important piece of advice it would be this: encourage yourself. Talk to yourself and believe in yourself. I didn't have much of a support system. My family and friends thought I was being lazy or spoiled because I was afraid to leave the house. So I became my own support system. I felt so proud of myself and no matter what I focused on my accomplishments and rewarded myself. If you drive to the end of your driveway and back, then GOOD JOB YOU BADASS BECAUSE YOU JUST TRIED AND SUCCEEDED!!! If you tried to drive a mile down the road and you panicked, then GOOD JOB YOU BADASS, YOU JUST DROVE, PANICKED AND STILL MADE IT! EVEN A PANIC ATTACK COULDN'T KEEP YOU FROM REACHING THAT GOAL!

Another thing I want to mention is this: I always thought the ""focus on your breathing"" thing was bullshit. I thought, ""That probably helps some people but my anxiety is more **complex**."" Well I'm here to tell you, friend, that focused breathing will help you. Anxiety starts to seem intricate and meaningful but at the end of the day it really isn't. It's just basic fear. Monitoring your breathing and learning to control it is very helpful. Don't underestimate the power of breathing.

I just wanted to share my experience. If anyone would like to talk or if you need encouragement to overcome this crippling fear, please feel free to reach out to me. Driving anxiety can leave you feeling so lonely. Everything is cool, my friend. You are not alone. You can do this!",anxiety,FortuneAndFae,2019/05/20

16905,lonely,"Where do you meet quality people? Feeling hopeless. Hey all, how’s everyone doing? A little backstory about me: I’m a 24 year old man, 6’1”, 230 pounds and muscular, an introverted/weirdo artist, an avid reader, explorer, and adventurer. Guitar and lifting weights are my primary hobbies. I’m an electrician involved in a union apprenticeship, so I make great money and have been self-sufficient/on my own for over 2 years now. I have suffered from crippling loneliness and chronic suicidal depression since I was 11. I was extremely scrawny when I was younger (130 pounds in high school) and over the last several years have made strong, active efforts to improve my life, get bigger, and become more confident. I’ve only ever had one real girlfriend who was much older than me (31) and she ended up gaslighting me for 2 years and presumingly cheating on me. Horrible waste of time, money, effort, and devastating to my mental health.
My problem is this. I seem to be doing all the right things for years...lifting, have a solid career, independent, talented, creative, nuanced...but I still struggle big time with loneliness. I have a hard time meet quality women and friends because most people my age are so entrapped in the party lifestyle and that’s not something that has ever fulfilled me. I just long for deeper bonds and relationships built on things that aren’t so purely meaningless and superficial.
A few weekends ago I went to 3 public libraries and just started confidently approaching women I thought were attractive and started making conversation and being flirty. Some were reciprocative, some were shy. I’m actively trying to meet worthwhile women but it’s extremely difficult because I’m naturally not a confident person and am chronically depressed. I think about committing suicide literally every single day because I feel that all of my efforts to improve myself are useless if I have nobody to share them with, nobody to invest in, nobody to create a meaningful relationship with.

I watched a YouTube video about the unofficial diagnostic test that some of you may have seen. While it's very tongue in cheek, it made so much sense. 

I'm in my mid 30s now and while I manage OK, my late needs and early 20s were hard. I went from being a high achiever in most of my schooling but the wheels fell off in high school when I needed to actually study and self manage my time to pass. I had a long line of different jobs and ""careers"" and several failed attempts at studying. I also abused drugs and alcohol. A lot. 

Fast forward to now. I quit drugs and alcohol and am pretty healthy. I have completed my master's and run my own business. I put a heap of systems in place to make sure I don't forget stuff and manage myself. Still, I struggle with chronic procrastination and lots of difficulty with organisation. 

It was too easy... 

One thing I'm not sure about is how easy it was to get the diagnosis. I just rocked up to this neurologist today and told him why I think I have ADHD. I gave him a completed self-rating scale and he just said ""yeah sounds like you have ADHD"". Then he wrote me a script for dexamphetamine. 

I mean, what if I just lied to him and made it all up!? 
I guess it's possible I don't have ADHD... But I think it's unlikely. I have done my research and I feel like I do have this disorder. 

I'm really interested to see how I respond to this medication, but I'm also scared as fuck. The aspect of my job that I struggle with is the part that requires deep research and focus. I've tried Pomodoro and all that and it has helped to an extent. I hope these meds help. 

What are the downsides? I understand there are some side effects but the doc just said they are rare. 

I was wondering if it was OK to only take them on days when I need to focus and not on other days. The doctor didn't really say much, he said I don't have to take them every day. 

How has medication helped you?

4201,adhd,"Is it just me or do the symptoms of ADHD look like permanent drug withdrawal? My wife watched a doco about a woman who got caught up in the wrong crowd and went missing, probably murdered. The interviewees who knew the woman reminded my wife of us when we were young - aimless, super emotional. We just didn't get into drugs, except tobacco and the occasional pot.

I figured that some of those people probably had ADHD as well, but drugs bring a host of other issues. The doco claimed that their aggressiveness came from drug-withdrawal, and so she is thinking our treatment is making us more aggressive. We have been, lately, but there are tons of other stress-related explanations for that as well. I, on the other hand, think our treatment makes us calmer and think more clearly. One of the psychs on youtube (Dr. Russell Barkely? maybe another one) claimed that ADHD was like having type 1 diabetes of the brain. The treatment definitely makes me feel functional and like I'm not missing something. When it's worn off, I do feel more agitated and so on...which very closely mimics drug withdrawal. 

Years ago people told me I'd feel normal after about a month of quitting smoking because the brain starts producing dopamine again, and the withdrawal is over. A year later I was still waiting and craved cigarettes like I did when I had just quit. I talked about my experience online, a couple people mentioned ADHD, and the rest is history.

I’ve never suffered from anxiety consistently in the past but the whole of this last week I’ve been unable to stay asleep.

When I’m awake in my day to day life I don’t suffer anxiety at all and really enjoy my life. 

I believe this all started when I smoked strong cannabis socially (I’m a non smoker) and had edibles. I completely overdosed and it was the worst experience of my life. I suffered from psychosis and short term memory loss leading to intense paranoia throughout the trip, for around 4 hours.

I didn’t think about it for weeks but recently it’s come back into my mind and every time I close my eyes to sleep the anxiety comes.

16655,lonely,"So alone and I don’t know what to do I am 39 and divorced. I have 3 beautiful daughters and they, honestly, are the only thing that has kept me going the last few years. I try to consider myself blessed. I have my daughters and they are so amazing in every way. Smart, funny, wonderful personalities. They are all beautiful and really starting to hit their stride and find themselves in life. It is a true joy to be there father and to see them grow and develop into  the wonderful young ladies they are becoming. I tell myself that is more then enough. I am greedy wanting more. There are so many others who have it worse then I do. 

I have lived through a lot in my life. I don’t think I’m extraordinary in anyway, but I do feel sometimes like the amount of shit I’ve been through has been excessive. I might eventually write it all down, but it honestly has been a lot. And I used to be strong. I was the glue that held my family together growing up. I was the one. I found the love of my life and I couldn’t have been luckier. We were in love. In every way. We had babies and it was like a dream. And then more tragedy. I didn’t handle it well. For the first time I wasn’t strong. I was weak, so fucking weak. So pathetic. And now, the aftermath is too much to bear. I lost everything. Everything I love, everything I own. Now all I have left is my daughters half the time. It’s not enough. The thought of them not with me at all times is almost unbearable. I tried to give myself time. To adjust, to move on. It’s been almost three years since we split and sure there are days it doesn’t hurt as much as it once did. But the other days? It still feels so fresh. There are mornings I wake up and I look around and think, this can’t possibly be real. I had everything I wanted in life and now I’m alone. 

I tried dating a little. Actually, I have been on two dates and had a couple one night stands. I felt nothing. I want someone. I want to love. I want to find all of that again. I am kind of a sappy, hopeless romantic. And I miss the little romantic things. I miss the goodnight and good morning kisses. The hugs and smiling face when I get home. The little notes and texts. I miss my best friend. I want, desperately to find that again. But I feel so lost. I have literally gone out like 4 times in the nearly 3 years. I have literally no family except my kids. Nobody. My friends are all older like me and have kids and families. They don’t go out. I have tried tinder and bumble and match, but everything is so different. I am nearly 40, I have put on weight, a lot of moms and dads can relate I’m sure. I never had trouble getting a date when I was younger, but now it’s hard to get anyone I am remotely attracted to to swipe right on me. And I know that’s not the best way to find someone. But I can’t seem to force myself to go to a bar or anywhere else alone. It’s so hard to make friends at this age. I don’t know how people do it. 

I have tried repeatedly to go out. I have joined a gym. I work out. I have improved my diet so much. Cutting out fast foods, cooking my own meals basically every day. I have read more then ever. So there are some things I have done better. But the loneliness is killing me. When I don’t have my girls, I am a sad, shell of myself. There are some days on the weekend where I haven’t even left bed. I try to force myself up, to get out, do anything, but I can’t seem to do it. The loneliness only grows. 

I know I messed up. A lot. I made this mess for myself. I let my depression, sadness and guilt consume me, overtake me. And I am reaping everything I showed. Yet my ex isn’t without some blame. During my hardest time she was out with another man. So there has always been some anger and so much hurt and betrayal there. I know I should move on. And honestly, I basically have. From her at least. I mourn the family I lost, the life I lost. I don’t mourn her any longer. But it doesn’t make it easier. I don’t know how to get out of this funk. I don’t know where to begin. I have a good job, but it’s a small company and we just, finally got health insurance. So I will be going to the doc after the first and talking to someone. The last thing I want is to get on medication, but maybe that’s what I need. 

So I’m not sure where to go from here. I never in a million years thought I would be this guy. I have always had friends, always been social. I was popular and the center of so much fun and attention at one point. And now, I am this sad man who is completely, utterly alone. The days I don’t have my children I feel like I might be better off dead. I wouldn’t ever consider that, not even a consideration. But it doesn’t stop me from thinking about it or sometimes wishing for it. I don’t want to be the weird guy who is alone at 40, at 50. This is no way to live. 

I am sorry if I come across whiny or pathetic. I am so overwhelmed with this, all the time. I look forward to going to work, to interact and actually do something. I just am not sure where to go from here. I don’t want my kids to think less of me. To think their dad is a loser who is alone. But where do I go from here? How do I change? How do I fix this? I want, so badly, to be the person I used to be. To be confident and fun. To be a person people gravitate to, people like and want to spend time with. I want to be a man my kids are proud to call dad. I know they love me completely and are proud to call me dad, but as they get older I wonder if that will change. I wonder what would happen if I got sick or hurt. Who would help me if I needed that help. I wonder how I can make it the next 5, 10 years or even longer feeling this completely alone. Hopefully I will break out of this and life will be great again one day. But I can’t even fathom how at this point.",lonely,KinkyGriffey,2019/05/28

6931,anxiety,"DAE experience “anxiety paralysis” where you’re unable to make a decision under stress? So I have no idea what to call it but the best way to describe it is delayed decision making under stress. Like my mind might say “you should do xyz” but my body won’t cooperate and it’s like I’m literally paralyzed. XYZ could be anything. For example, I missed my bus stop yesterday (was used to other riders ringing the bell that when no one did i got caught off guard) and instead of simply getting off the next one, I sat inside the bus and passed maybe 3-4 stops to get off and find my way back to the train station. The whole time my brain was thinking, okay, I’m in a different town, I should get off at this next stop but how would I find my way back? Oh look, some kids from my school got off here I should have gotten off with them. Okay, when I do get off, do I order an uber or walk? We’re too far from the station for me to walk all the way back. Bla bla bla bla. Okay, I’m getting off at this stop. 

I did eventually get off and found a subway line and made it safely to the train station, but the whole experience made me feel stupid. Like I could have avoided all that trouble if I had just gotten off at the next stop, but I didn’t react fast enough. Is this an anxiety thing? Or am I just slow? It was kindly pointed out by someone that at least I found a solution in the end even though it took me long enough to get there. 

I don’t act like this all the time. Most of the time I don’t make mistakes and stay on top of things. Other times I get caught off guard and act like an idiot. Some cases are more mild than others, where the consequences are harmless. Like me not saying anything when I notice a minor mistake but I’m unable to let the words out. 

Any insight would be great. ",anxiety,anxiouswreckk,2019/02/13

4421,adhd,"Insurance won’t cover my prescribed dosage, so I’ve adopted a compromised way to get me through the work-week. Hello, guys! This is my first post on Reddit, so I apologize if it’s not in the correct sub or if the format is off (I’m posting from mobile).

So, I’ve been struggling with ADHD my whole life and my life changed dramatically, for the better, when I was prescribed medication 6 years back. However, about 2.5 years ago, I suffered a head injury which worsened my condition. My doctor increased my Adderall dosage from 40mg XR to 60mg, as this head injury really hurt my ability to concentrate and amplified all of my ADHD symptoms.

The problem is, my insurance company (Aetna) denies to cover this dosage. They will cover my old dosage of 40mg, but won’t allow the extra pill a day. I cannot afford to pay for my prescribed amount (60mg) out-of-pocket, as this can amount to $600+ pre-deductible, so I have had to settle for my old dosage so my insurance will cover it.

This dosage doesn’t cut it for me, so Mon-Fri I take the 60mg I am supposed to have, and I go without medication Sat &amp; Sun. My work environment is high-energy and requires me to be 100% mentally present, and 2/3 of my dosage doesn’t cross the threshold that I need. 

I am a complete blob on the weekends. I have to go without medication so that I have enough to get me through the month. I sleep for extremely long amounts of time, don’t want to socialize, and any minor task I complete is quite a big achievement for me. 

I think a 4 day long 10 hr/day work-week would dramatically increase my quality-of-life, but unfortunately that is not an option with my current job. I do want to point out that I’m aware 60mg/day is a high dosage, but my concentration and energy issues are really that bad.

Has anybody else encountered a similar situation with their insurance company? Is there anything I can do to actually receive my prescribed dosage? If not, what are some ways to cope with the weekend laziness? Any input or advice is appreciated :)",adhd,meowser64,2018/12/07

18742,mindfulness,"Mindfulness and Social Media Staying connected with friends and family is a big part of our lives today. Using social media is... well... you know.

I really believe in being conscious of what we are doing instead of just ""eating chips"". Social media, WhatsApp etc can be more meaningful if I just observe myself while I'm using it. I try to set the intention, before I open the app, to be aware of the things I'm doing. Just aware of the scrolls and clicks, kind of like I'm watching myself doing it. The moment I catch myself drifting off, I close it and go and do something else outside of the phone. 

I try to put my fullest attention to writing friends or family, asking what's going on, how they are doing, engaging with them etc.  It doesn't mean I need to write them a novel. I think of them as a person standing right in front of you, looking into their eyes, while typing. That's all I have to do. This makes the screen time more meaningful and surprisingly more efficient.

The last thing I would say is just that I avoid the news feeds of fb, videos etc. They are really a waste of time. They are not really a reflection of what is happening, because the happening is the moment in which it is happening, not a teaser of or a snippet of a video of someone's life on fb.

4994,adhd,"Text-to-Speech or Read Aloud Features are amazing! tldr: I have discovered ""read aloud"" features on electronic stuff I have to read for school in different computer apps, and it has really helped me stay focused and read my stuff in a timely manner, and I wanted to share how and why that is, and tell people it is helpful.



I just wanted to share this- I have a lot of trouble staying focused when reading textbooks or articles or things for school. Recently I was messing around with the settings for my textbook on my Kindle PC app, and I saw this ""text to speech"" thing and clicked on it. And a voice started reading me the words!

For several reasons, it really helped me focus on reading. I often times like to think about things related to what I just read but then go off in fifty tangents and take forever to get back to actually reading, but because I discovered that, on the kindle app, if I pause or stop the reading voice it starts the whole page over, it feels like I have to stay focused more and I don't want to stop it to think about stuff until the page is over- and then sometimes I forget to and it's already half done with that page, so might as well let it keep going. And before I know it, I've done the whole reading!

Somehow though, with the way that the voice reads the words, I can kind of think about stuff in the back of my mind and make connections, and if I miss a word or two, while it reads out stuff that doesn't matter (the in-text citations, for example), I can kind of skim the last sentence. Also, even if I don't do that, for some reason having it read outloud just makes the whole thing make more sense even if I missed part of it.

So I've been getting to the end of my readings at  the pace the voice goes, without stopping a million times, without having to reread the same thing over and over- and I now can also time how long it takes to read a certain number of pages and so now I know how long it'll take to read x number of pages.

At first the reading voice seemed a bit slow, but actually I've found the pace to be perfect for me to be able to understand what I'm reading. I have found it's better to read along with the voice, but if I need to get up for a minute, just listening and coming back to it can be fine too.

The reading voice is also much better than a real human voice to me for some reason. I think it's because there isn't as much fluctuation in pitch, the speed is pretty much the same except when it comes up to dashes (it says the next word without as much space), periods (it says the next word after a pause), and at the end of a line (it says the next word without pause). This hasn't been a problem for me though, and it does have some modualtion in pitch like for questions and such, but too much. I think human voices are hard for me to listen to because sometimes their voice itself might become distracting to what they're actually saying, or they might not articulate their words well, or they might read the words wrong, or something else that I don't really know how to explain, but I just find it harder to listen to real human voices than this computerized voice.

I also started looking for this feature on other things. It's on Word, and on Adobe PDF, and some internet sites for scholarly articles. And if I have something online that doesn't have this, I can download it and turn it into a pdf, or copy and paste it into Word.

I just wanted to share this because it's been so helpful to me and has saved me so much time, because it would typically take me several hours to read something that, at the slowish, but steady pace the reading voice goes, takes 30 minutes. I wish had discovered this earlier, it would've made my life a lot easier. But, I'm glad I've discovered it now, and I wanted to share this in case it might help anyone else who doesn't know about it.",adhd,NaeltaLaCrea,2019/10/10

I understand if you want to downvote me or bash me in the comments. It’s normal for a human to want to get rid of/avoid any thing that causes a negative feeling in the brain. Thats what evolution is based on.

I have ADHD and have studied neuroscience for 15 years. The sorrowful truth is that people who have ADHD/ADD can’t never be as happy as neurotypical people because we lack the dopamine/norepinephrine in our brains. We can be happy but not so much naturally as people without ADHD.     

(You can feel more like a neurotypical human with medication, but i don’t recommend it to any of my patients. No one with ADHD should start medication  ! IMO !. The medication will desensitize your dopamine/norepinephrine receptors on the long run and you will feel worse after quitting them.)

Here I am watching this animated video on youtube called ""TIMELAPSE OF THE FUTURE: A journey to the end of time"". in this pretty cool video, it displays our planet going through it's normal life cycle in a time lapse, beginning in 2019 and going further into the future, the unknown. you'll see Mountains forming and rivers carving the landscape, meteors  crashing onto the surface and volcanos erupting causing massive amount of debris. then it shows small clips of the universe, our sun and other stars. beautiful visuals of our galaxy from a satellites perceptive. pretty much a glimpse of our nature passing through time. 

years passing by like seconds.

And here we are as people just along for the ride, I guess.

The first question that runs through my mind is "" where do our lives take place in this journey?""

&amp;#x200B;

Not necessary talking about human existence but human experiences such as emotions and feelings. I feel like one of the only things we have gotten good at as a civilization is making things that don't matter...matter.

&amp;#x200B;

putting ourselves in this bubble where nature exist but only how we want it to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Such as mourning a death for example, death is something  that has always happened before our time and will continue to happen even after  after our time. not speaking like we really have much of a choice weather to feel emotional about  losing a loved one but that's mainly because our culture taught us to be that way. imagined if we were taught celebrate deaths of loved ones or not even to pay attention to it as much as we do when someone passes away.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that comes to mind is that as humans, we realize that according to nature we are not that important, but if we create our own bubble, we can be. Creating something where we can be the center of our universe and maybe then, our lives won't seem so pointless and small..

I keep doubting wether or not my job is the one cause my anxiety or if it’s just in general. I have not the most stress free job but it’s not super stressful, I get paid fairly well and my colleagues are nice to work with also.

I mean it all sounds good but ever since I started there 2 years ago my anxiety has gotten worse. It’s a corporate environment and anything that happens or something I do by mistake my anxiety hits the roof. I use to have the odd times at previous jobs however this one seems to have just brought it on even more. 

There fairly social as well and go out for drinks. I always go to be sociable but this always effects my anxiety a bit more. That being as majority of people have “the fear” or thinking back to embarrassing conversations.

I just don’t know what to do? Is it the environment I’m in and because I’m not use to it? Do I stop attending the drinks more often?

I eventually found a practice that worked for me in TM or Transcendental Meditation. I have been practicing it for over a year and I have received really strong results. One of the areas that I feel is lacking with TM, due to it's inherent simplicity and secrecy as a practice , is the greater discussion around the lessons and ideas one can become aware of mindfulness. Watching this podcast was a great treat because Shinzen Young was able to mathematically communicate some of the emotional benefits I have received via meditation. I am posting here instead of r/Meditation because Shinzen is more relevant to mindfulness and I would love to hear if anyone else found similar benefits from the podcast.

Because I think I've only had one panic attack in my life, considering all I have read about them -- I wasn't able to move, my heart was racing, I thought I was going to die, I felt terrified and despite being in the room with someone I couldn't say anything. It passed and I fell asleep, but everything was different in the morning. I have concluded that this was probably derealization; it lasted for 6 months or so until it subsided. It was truly awful. That was 6 or 7 years ago and I haven't experienced those things since.   


On the other hand, I am a very anxious person and mainly am triggered by social situations, in addition to food/eating and a few other things. I have intense anxiety every single day in a variety of situations. I dread going places, dread seeing people, so much dread and fear in my life all the time for such minuscule things. When I feel these moments of 'dread', they feel different than the 'panic attack' that I think I had. I tend to feel very scared, I have a terrible feeling of dread in my stomach and chest, my mind is racing and I have an extreme inability to focus. What are all of your experiences? I just want to know exactly what is happening to me, and whether I'm right to call it anxiety or panic attacks, because I feel like I invalidate lots of people by saying I have 'panic attacks' when I really don't even know if that's the right term.

6327,anxiety,"Anxiety about eating...anybody else? Thankfully I have for the most part grown out of this particular anxiety. But all the way through middle school, high school, and college and beyond (35 now), I had the worst anxiety about eating around people. I think it probably started with puberty and my anxiousness manifesting as extreme nausea which made eating impossible. I’d get sick all the time when the tiniest uncomfortable situation would upset me. I remember my mother running out of gas one day and we were really close to home and literally across the street from a gas station and I barfed all over the side of the road because I was so anxious about the situation. Then I think that grew into being immensely uncomfortable eating in front of people i wasn’t comfortable around or at places I wasn’t comfortable in. You can imagine how horrifying going out with friends for dinner, eating with friends families, or the prospect of a date was! I felt like such a freak and would find ways to play it off, but people seriously thought I had an eating disorder, which maybe I did. But if I was comfortable with someone I’d eat fine. After college when I had my first long term boyfriend I finally had enough of a comfort level to eat a regular meal in front of a boy (gasp)! Without being sick! It was a huge achievement and kept getting better over the years. And it was never about worrying that people would think I was fat I remember PRAYING that I’d love to be fat if it meant not constantly worrying about eating around people! I’d have relapses like when I started dating new people again or being in an uncomfortable situation but now I guess I’ve outgrown my stomach anxieties. And boy have I gained weight lol.

4507,adhd,"Parents refuse to let me take medication and get help After nearly failing two years of high-school, I finally convinced my parents to get me tested for ADHD back in August. My results came back (full psychological analysis) and I was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive form) and severe depression. It’s always been obvious that I have some sort of attention issue, and my parents realized that something was off about my attention/focus-span, but they always dismissed it, by saying I’m “too smart to have ADHD or ADD”, when they were confronted by teachers or coaches, about my misbehavior or inattention. Growing up, I was pretty smart, I got straight A’s and was placed into all gifted classes (not trying to pull some r/iamverysmart-type shit) but it all fell apart when my attention issues started becoming more and more prevalent. Soon, my straight A’s dropped to C’s and B’s, and I was forced to leave the IB program. I’m enjoying regular school much more, and I’m not really considered a “nerd” anymore (music and weightlifting have become good outlets for my anger/frustration with life), but I’m not really showing any signs of improvement. I take a resource class (doesn’t really help, my resource teacher found out I smoke, and now blames my weed-related habits instead of the legitimate attention issue I was diagnosed with) and visit a therapist, but my parents still refuse to let me take medication. Does anyone have an idea on how to convince them to let me try medication? I talked to my therapist about it, but she said she couldn’t help me. Should I push the idea (more than I have), or wait another two years until I graduate? I’m worried, because my grades aren’t very good, and I know I could be doing much better, if I was able to focus and organize myself. 

TL:DR- Parents think I’m “too smart” for ADHD to be a problem, and won’t let me take medication or get help, apart from taking a resource class at school.

“Daytime is full of uncontrolled, confusing stimuli which may cause emotional instability for pwADHD; while at night, the environmental stimuli are way less confusing, therefore easy to be designed. People with ADHD are also daydreamers. They crave for excitement, but when it’s not based on their patterns of imagination, it may hurt.

I found her immediately after it happened and was able to apply pressure to the wound and set her down in case she lost consciousness while I yelled for someone to call 911. 

After the ambulance came my bf and I got in a stupid argument about how I handled the situation where he called me names, man handled me and threw me down resulting in us breaking up. 

I have some flash backs every once in awhile but I’ve managed to keep them from effecting me too much but the one thing I’ve noticed is that I’ve become super obsessed with mauves and pinks. 

I’ve never been the girl that HAD to have pink things. I never hated it but I didn’t absolutely love it but now... all my school things are pink or mauve or a shade like them. My notes are written in similar colors. Every new article of clothing I’ve bought since has been pink, makeup is more pink/red/mauve and I even went and had my hair dyed pink...

Any time I see these colors I’m instantly attracted to it and usually have to keep it/buy it and have gone out of my way to add more pinks to my everyday life. Comforters/sheets. Mugs/tumblers. Key chains. Coats. Purses/wallets. Jewelry.

One thing that has helped me right out of the gate is my breathing technique. I can do it anywhere at anytime, and it helps bring me right back to center, to the here and now, especially when I recognize a negative thought spiral coming on.

I touch the tip of my tongue to the back of my upper front teeth and relax my jaw so my teeth are not touching. This results in the front third (or so) of my tongue resting on the roof of my mouth. Then I breathe in through my nose, mentally counting 1-2-3-4, and then back out, counting 1-2-3-4. The pace is about 4 seconds in and 4 seconds out or longer. It's a common part of yoga practice, but you can do it anywhere.

Dear Brains,

I am struggling with motivation lately and would love to have some external motivation added. So I adopted the Roulette method for tasks. As it is with external motivation, I need buddies so that I can continue to be interested. Please join me if you are interested and I will be your task buddy as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I planned it:

\- there will be check-ins every two weeks until June 26, which is also the final.

\- Today I selected with a random nr generator 7 numbers, which now became my 7 tasks for the next two weeks. I will put them in a comment below.

\- Any tasks that i will be able to complete, i can replace with new randomly generated nr and task at next check-in. Tasks that i did not complete i will keep until i can finish them, even if it takes 2 months.

\- The aim is to complete as many as I can, I plan to keep a count of how many i have completed.

Tasks were inspired by executive functions, some are working memory related, some are planning related, some are meant to just motivate to start.

7035,anxiety,"I can’t relate to anyone (This is going to sound so pretentious and conceited- heads up) 

I recognised the cycle now, procrastination and then the inevitable self hatred that follows. 

I’m nineteen and I am plagued with this constant need to create something significant, I want to become more skilled, obtain more knowledge and information abt almost everything. I want to develop as a designer/artist. I feel like there is so much I can do with my time in this world and my mind can’t seem to focus on anything.

I see a pattern now, for a few months I will force myself through anything and burn out, then hate myself for whatever lack of work I have produced, or work that I still see as inadequate. 

I’m not exaggerating abt the “burning out” aspect of my issue, I literally had a breakdown in the street after I experienced what I think was either my first ever full blown panic attack or just my body literally breaking down from stress I put myself through. My family literally found me passed out on the kitchen floor when I was working six days a week and sleeping only two hours a night, (granted I was lowkey starving myself and incredibly anemic) 

I guess my fears are mostly concerning what I leave this world with and wanting to become something more.  

I realised how different my priorities are compared to other ppl my age after talking to a girl at work who said that even if she obtained millions, she would still choose to work in retail.

I could not even contemplate a response to that bc it seemed so absurd, why would she willingly continue working?. 

So asked her and she said she didn’t have anything else to do with her time, that she needed the interactions she gets from customers. 

I just couldn’t fathom how an individual could live in this world with so many opportunities and have nothing else to do outside of serving customers and cleaning everyday. Ik that sounds pretentious, though literally half my anxiety stems from the fact that I feel there’s not enough time to do everything. There is so much in this world I still haven’t seen/experienced. 

I haven’t watched a movie in a year because I can’t get through a minute without starting to feel antsy and bored. I can sit and read a book for hours everyday yet for some reason I can’t force myself to sit and stare at a screen unless I’m multitasking bc I literally can’t control it. 
I feel like I’m wasting time if I’m not doing something remotely productive. 

I feel like it’s kinda unhealthy how my expectations for myself determine how I treat myself, I can’t stop the anxiety and it’s becoming worse and worse everyday. Idk how to stop the cycle bc there’s literally nothing else I would rather do in my spare time than learn and work on art and developing enough skill to calm my anxiety.

**Happy New year!!** 

To me, and to everyone out there! &lt;3

So here's how I spent my new year's eve...

All alone, in my room, lying in bed, pretending I'm cramping so I can avoid my parents. meanwhile, people are out there celebrating the new year and watching beautiful fireworks with friends and family. 

**why am I avoiding my family you ask?**  
well, let me tell you. I avoid them because I can't deal with them. when we talk, we fight. and when they see me they latch onto me and start either 1. bombarding me with questions I don't want to answer or 2. asking me to do things for them or 3. reprimanding me on being a bad daughter and comparing me to all the other great daughters all their friends have. so, yes, I go as far as pretending to be sick to avoid them.

Back to my new year's eve, I stayed in bed watching lame Netflix shows and playing a mobile game. which by the way no one was online because they all had new year plans and parties, while sad little old me sat in her bed playing the game all by my lonesome. 

**Why aren't I at a party or watching fireworks with my friends?** 

simple. because my parents won't let me. I am a 24-year-old adult who is still very much controlled by her parents. all the while, my younger brother is allowed to come and go as he pleases. and the funny thing is... that's what inspired me to start writing this post

Every time I left my room, I felt so sad. I saw my brother's room empty and I knew he was out having fun with his friends, while I was trapped in my room because I wasn't allowed to do anything. so I thought maybe I can start writing a blog to relieve some of my emotions and at least feel like I've accomplished something today.

And that's how I spent my new years...

Hope you had a better one &lt;3",lonely,LobsterCleopatra,2019/01/01

4217,adhd,"An organizational tool at work Hi, all. I am in a new position where I need to be organized... and need to create systems that work for me. I have found this INCREDIBLY useful and wanted to share in case others find it useful. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have initiated weekly check-ins with my supervisor. They are about an hour (but could go longer). It sounds like a lot, but she is rarely in the office, so I can't always just stop by her desk to ask her questions. Having this on the calendar is helpful. She finds them helpful too so it's not a problem for either of us. 

\- Before each meeting, I send her an agenda of what I want to cover. This is a dated document that I have saved in a folder literally titled ""Weekly check-ins."" Whenever something comes up I want to discuss with her, I add it to this list. Sometimes I add notes in the agenda doc if needed. 

\- At the meeting, I take the agenda and type my notes in it, including action items. She sometimes also adds agenda items that I type into my document. 

\- If there are big projects or tasks I need to do, I generally ask for a due date even if she doesn't provide one. I note that. 

\- At the end of the meeting, I take the action items and paste them on a running monthly action-item list. Anything that I can accomplish in under 5 minutes, I do immediately. 

\- I look at the agenda from the meeting and decide what needs to stay and be re-visited at the next meeting. I then keep that information in a new document saved in the check-ins folder with the new date.  

\- Throughout the week, I continue to fill out the next week's agenda as needed. I check off my to-do list as I go.  I also keep a clipboard with hard-copy documents she needs to sign or approve... and have started also adding anything to be discussed if it needs a hard-copy paper version and not just to be sent over email. If I have documents specifically for discussion at the next meeting that don't need to ""live"" somewhere else on shared files, I save them in the ""check-in"" folder too so they are easy to pull up at the meeting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have also instituted an action-items policy at work with our weekly staff meetings (I am not our executive director, but right under her). Our admin takes notes during the meeting, but keeps a separate section for action-items for each person. At the beginning of each meeting, I take us through them to see what was done and what wasn't. It's not a punitive thing -- just a check-in. Some of the items get a different month added to them or timeframe if they stay on too long and aren't urgent. If we start talking about an item for more than 30 seconds, we stop and add it as an agenda item. The action items are done quickly (usually 5 minutes or less) and have made all of us a bit more productive at least.  

As with my other system -- if there is an action item assigned to me that I can complete in under 5 minutes, I do it immediately following the meeting. If not, they get added to my running to-do list. I also check the action item list an hour or two before each staff meeting to see if there is anything else I can either get done or at least make progress on before the meeting. The accountability matters to me, even if I know I won't be penalized for it.

19115,mindfulness,"I took one step back, but three steps forward. I’ve been going through a break up. First week, I was a mess. Second week, I’m doing a bit better. 

I created distance between my ex - Who very much wants to remain friends - and I. 

I sent him a text 5 days in and I realized I simply was not yet ready to communicate with him. I began to experience feelings of self-defeat, loneliness, and boredom. 

Yesterday was the worst it’s been in a week. This is okay, though. I allowed myself to fall apart and I wasn’t really utilizing my coping skills so it’s no wonder I was in suffering.

I talked to my older friend, who is a real spiritual guy, on the phone for three hours today and wow did I really need it! 

Here are a few things I’ve noticed and come to accept: 

- I’m not ready to talk to my ex yet nor to be his friend. It’s going to take some time for me to slowly reintroduce him into my life. Before I was in the mindset of, “Wow, I got to hurry up and talk to him before he begins to forget me and really fall out of love with me.” 

Now, I know that no matter what, I need to do this for myself. Creating space between him and I is essential to me bettering myself. 

- I had my ex’s number blocked on my phone, but I recently unblocked him. Why did I have it blocked? Cause I was constantly expecting him to message me. This was unhealthy of me so I finally felt ready to keep him unblocked and I’m not checking my notifications in the hopes of seeing a message from him pop up. 

This is good. This is a small victory.

- I was desperate to move on first before he could move on and find someone else. Immediately, I was on the loose like a wild animal in the hopes of luring prey which I could feast upon to fill the holes in my life. Today, I realized I can’t be doing that. To be seeking potential “fillers” is just not the way to go and is detrimental to my progress and to others. 

- I realized that, while I very much want to help people, I can’t see myself working for the public as a career. I decided I have an interest in cyber security. My friend was like, “Hey I have this computer. I never use it. I will send it to you so you can learn. It’s in good shape and there isn’t any strings attached to this offer.” I decided to accept his kind endeavor, for currently I have no laptop or access to a computer. Just my good old mobile phone.

TLDR; 

Within the span of three hours, I realized so damn much. I was able to speak my pure truths and I know I’m not a defective product. I just have much to work on. I need to have patience with myself and trust the process. I’m learning to forgive and accept the mistakes past babs (me) has made, I’m helping present babs get out of her shell  and regulate herself so that future babs doesn’t have to pay the price.

My roomate and I were assigned randomly, we have a lot of the same interests and get along nicely. But last year (in dorms) she would put her headphones in a play game or talk to her boyfriend while she was in the room. 


This year we are in am apartment, and as soon as she gets home she'll shut herself in her room and lock the door. I don't think I've actually laid eyes on her the last two days. 


In class last year I made One friend. She had 3 classes with me and she--like the kind soul she is--would talk to me everyday. 

This One Friend and I have just 1 class together now, but she has 4 other people in that class. I want to be these people's friends bit I don't know them and I think it's be weird to insert myself into their conversation.

The more I read about it the more I realize that a lot of those things I hate about myself have stemmed from ADHD and it makes correcting them a lot easier (especially while I'm medicated).

Right now my biggest issue is getting out of bed in the morning. It's almost impossible for me. In the past I attributed it to depression, but lately it hasn't been the same. It's not that I don't want to get out of bed because I don't want to face the world, but it's that I can't. I tell myself ""you need to get up now so you aren't scrambling to not be late"" and my body just won't move.

i've been doing a style of somatic mindfulness where i basically work with the natural healing flow afforded by the psyche/subconscious

i allow material to arise as it often does throughout the days

and then at some point i'll try to make sense of it and struggle with it until i have this epiphany

as you know, trauma is stored in the body, and it's quite the fight to become aware of the somatic stuff going on

usually it will be tension that is stored in cracks and crevices dividing up muscle/organ 

the tension becomes released through pulsations and heat and sometimes aching, accompanied often my increased heart rate

this change in physiology is accompanied by a mental change in belief system and of course an overall change in behaviour - due to the processing and elimination of that fear (tension)

as i am no longer blocked by that tension and fear i was holding onto about that thing

i have been doing this work for 2 years and honestly.. i've kept it on the DL because i just wasn't sure about what it was and a lot of beliefs were stopping me from sharing my experience (or even really knowing how to verbalise it when it started)

but now i'm a lot more confident in myself and i realised i ought to start talking about it

i've done so many layers of it, probably in the hundreds, so i know it's real now

so there it is. i'm sure some people here MUST be doing this work as well without needing to call it cptsd or anything like that

i wanna start connecting with you

i know some of you will be like ""this is somatic psychotherapy!!"" but like i guess i wanna know ppl who do it at home themselves

i am going to start seeing a somatic psychotherapist tho fingers crossed she approves of my methods

bc honestly i can't ttell you how much i've healed 

i mean healing is natural, our bodies don't need external stimuli to know how to heal wounds, and it reasons neither do our minds

4584,adhd,"Adderall and Skin Damage/Aging? So I've been reading alot online that Adderall can cause permanent skin damage or premature aging. While I haven't noticed it having any effect on my face, I can't still help but worry. I drink insane amounts of water, I work out every other day of the week, and I eat alot of sardines, tuna, apples and bananas. 

I also haven't been taking it very long. Only about maybe 5-6 months (probably not even). My doctor said she'd never heard anything about premature aging after I asked her about it, she almost looked at me like the thought was rediculous. When I read the 2018 FDA pharmaceutical handbook, it didn't mention amphetamines having anything to do with skin.

I’m a white male and had heterosexual sex about 8 weeks ago.

I tested negative with an in-home antibody test (Oraquik) at 6.5 weeks, but I’ve heard conflicting reviews on the technology.

Stayed in the library until 9PM or so - I got a lot of different tasks done, but only actually studied for 2 hours or so. 

Yesterday, I took the meds at 7 am and was at work until 5PM. I noticed that I was feeling sleepy and had a developing headache starting at 3pm and it got worse until 6 pm when I took Tylenol. I couldn't really study or focus after spending an hour at Starbucks and was really annoyed and mad at myself.

Today, I went to work and got out at 12 PM. I took my pill at 1 PM and then started working around 2, but couldn't focus. I picked up my kids from school and then went to study again at 4PM. I was really irritated by the new library I went to - and couldn't focus for crap. I got through a few pages, and it was pretty good, but I also had a small headache. I'm gonna try studying again until the library closes, but so far it's just been my random thoughts and daydreams coming again, and being irritated by any little noise I can hear - not being unable to focus.

It's really counter-intuitive for me because adderall helps me so much at work and getting my own personal goals done. But in terms of sitting down at a test and just getting hyper focused on it, it seems to make things harder. I feel like adderall may help me to manage multiple tasks or a multi-part task better, but that it comes at a cost of hyper focus on a single task -- which a standardized test basically is since it's a series of separate questions one after the other.

At monday, I had to take my first ever test at the Uni. I really prepared myself for that exam en was so nervous I slept really bad the night before. I decided that I could take the car and drive, so I wasn't depending on the trains and bus. It took me one hour and a half (normally a 36 min drive) to get there, so my stress level was already through the roof. I ran into the building, only to see I mixed up the dates and had studied for the exam that was taking place this Thursday 😭.

I'm 24, and have only been licensed since age 22, though I took private lessons from a driving instructor who taught me defensive driving. However, since being licensed I have ""hurt"" my car a couple times (scraping it trying to park and a couple other things) and had one small accident coming out of a parking lot left turning into a car. This has not given my already-worrying parents a lot of confidence in me, when initially I think they thought I'd be a good driver.  


Once I went through a stop sign (four way I believe) with passengers accidentally with no other cars around at 11pm (I work late at a hotel) and I was so upset and shaken about it I cried the whole way home :/ That was a few months ago. I've also gotten two red light traffic cam violations because one time I thought I could make it but slowed down+ sheepishly went thru a red at 20mph. The other time I didn't know it was wrong bc I was turning on a red right turn but it was the 2nd lane (there were 2 right turn lanes) and so I guess you can only turn in the near right turn lane on red.  


ANYways, combined with all of that, today I was driving to a sleep clinic appointment (I also have sleep apnea, and was originally seeing my psychiatrist for OCD, which is why I'm ruminating about this lmao) and while I was stopping to turn left on a 35mph highway with one lane to cross to get to my street, I saw this bicylist that had his left arm out like he was gonna change into a lane. It distracted me, so for some reason when I turned my head back to start turning left bc I guess I must have seen it was clear before, in that second an car zoomed past me. I've been so upset about this all day, bc what if I'd started turning a couple seconds earlier??? I would assume I would see the car bc I would have looked right toward uncoming traffic, but I can't figure out why I stepped on the gas looking straight to my destination FIRST like you look right first what the actual fuck.  
I mean the person was almost definitely speeding to an extent but that is no excuse... I'd had a hard time going to sleep last night and had only slept 4 or so hours so it might have been due to that as well :(  


I haven't been on any successful ADD medication yet. One made my heartrate too high (tho it made me productive which was amazing!!!!! but also made me anxious) and then the other made me nauseous and seemed to have no positive affects. :/  
I remember my mom saying the first ADD drug I tried was helpful for alertness while driving. Of course now I feel the need to ""confess"" that near miss today which is ridiculous bc 1) I'm an adult and 2) it would be pointless.   
idk I'm just upset and guilty. the other car I don't even think noticed. I just can't figure out the ""what if"" scenarios if I'd turned earlier would I have seen it in time, etc etc

In my opinion is crucial you to respect first at all yourself. Your needs.

And that involves, from my point of view, listenning, taking into consideration and hugging yourself and your circumstances.

It's not required to work for keeping an ache, but, as far as I experience it, the best is first at all to see and accept it.  
Even though, it's not required at all to fight agains your wish of a life free of pain - Not at least if you don't want fight that.

19374,mindfulness,"Journaling tool Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

For a while now I've been doing sessions to just sit down and write about my daily experiences with mindfulness practice. This kind of journaling proved to be a great tool to consolidate what was going on through my head in a particular day.

&amp;#x200B;

I built a small tool to have a place for all my writings so I could refer back to any day and keep a record of my streaks. Also, there's a component to make the writing process easier: if you don't type for some seconds the text will fade away, until you get to 600 words. This makes me keep typing even if I feel there's not much to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I never really shared this small project with any community and though this could be a good start, if you feel like using it feedback is greatly appreciated: [https://typescri.be/](https://typescri.be/).",mindfulness,depazzi,2018/12/05

18810,mindfulness,"How to 'dissolve' Thoughts? Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

New to mindfulness here; every introductory guided meditation I can find is telling me to 'notice' thoughts, and that when I do, the thoughts will 'dissolve' or 'pop' or 'vanish'...

I can notice that I'm distracted, but then the thought doesn't go away just because I've noticed that I'm thinking... I'm capable of simultaneously (or EFFECTIVELY simultaneously) remembering some moment from a few days ago AND 'Hey, there's that moment from a few days ago.'

It seems like this should be obvious, but the more I notice that thought, the stronger it gets... 

I guess my question is: How does giving your attention to a thought cause it to vanish? I have a confuse. :(

 I feel like no one cares about me, I’m not important. Just a random girl struggling with life. So what’s the point of even trying my best? I’m scared to get suicidal because I often think I could die since I haven’t done anything in life, I don’t have anyone and I’m really REALLY tired.

One reason being is that I'm trying to gain hours, but more importantly, I love being able to empathize with those around me, pinpoint their needs and uncover areas of opportunity for meaningful transformation. 

As a holistic coach, I focus on all aspects of wellbeing whether that's mental, emotional, physical, spiritual etc... But I truly believe that everything starts from the inside out so a couple things I find my clients and I working on are thought work and emotional management. 

If you're interested feel free to send over a PM and I can provide you with more details to see if it's a good fit :)

Thanks!",mindfulness,manifestationcoach,2019/03/21
5018,adhd,"Productive procrastination This has become my new phrase. 

*Productive procrastination* 

What does it mean though? 

Quite literally that you’re being productive despite procrastinating. 

How do you do it? 

Easy! You do it more than you probably realize. It’s when you have to do something and are procrastinating, so instead you do something else that needs to get done. But like anything else. 

Need to prep for a big meeting?? Clean the dirty bathroom! Do the big pile of laundry! Walk the antsy dog! Make a spreadsheet! 

Voila! *Productive procrastination*",adhd,eleni_farrell,2019/04/20

6272,anxiety,"Attempting therapy again, hopefully going to psychiatrist this time! I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression since last year around the same. A nurse practitioner put my on antidepressants and they helped but i stopped taking them a few months ago because they made my overthinking worse.

I didn’t have a good experience with therapy tho. In the consultation, When I told the therapist about my almost daily weed habit, they freaked out. It was a therapist through my university, so due to me admitting my heavy usage(at this point it was only 3 months straight of heavy usage) and I checked a box that says some ppl are concerned about my weed habit, they made me go to the drug abuse counselor. I didn’t like it, didn’t feel comfortable expressing myself and I felt shitty because they really made it seem like I was drug addict and needed recovery. They actually tried to blame my diagnoses on weed, when clearly I told them I smoked a lot cause it helped. Imagine already being hesitant to do therapy, and they shun you away to the drug abuse and recovery building.. 

Anyway, I have found a psychiatrist in my area who’s my race(black) and she’s a woman, so I have hopes I’ll be more comfortable with her. Hopefully I’ll get a response by next week because my anxiety has been bad lately. I’ve been experiencing a lot of the physical sensations mainly like digestive problems, weird feeling in chest, and more jittery.",anxiety,AlmightyLiam,2019/09/13

As a disclaimer, I have been diagnosed with severe ADHD since 1997 and have been on medication since then, with brief breaks when there was a shortage or I was between jobs. I’ve managed to get far enough (a miracle) to graduate with a 3.9 gpa in my masters program. I’ve mostly been a therapist but have also been a supervisor. I recently started working once again as a therapist in substance abuse and left my previous supervisory position 4 months ago.

I had lunch earlier this week with a couple of coworkers to catch up. The previous position was “ok” but paid little and required a daily 45 minute drive each way. My former coworker told me over lunch that my former boss told everyone I had been a “terrible employee.” This was a shock. I certainly wasn’t the perfect employee, since I only worked there 3 months and was still learning. I’m not even sure what constitutes a “terrible employee.” I showed up on time, did my job, got along with everyone (as far as I know, who knows now?) and have two weeks notice when I found my current position which pays a little more and is much closer to home.

I’m really just perplexed and blindsided and now concerned that I’m missing things that I should have paid attention to.",adhd,bnwebm-123,2019/01/31

  the odds that these words would find you in an entire world full of words are so small, it could only be described as fate. Ergo, these words are meant for you. They were written for you, and depending on what you believe, God or chance lead you here. Either way, you're here. 
   There are few things that connect all of us as human beings. We all are born. We all die. We all breathe and sleep and eat and cry and laugh and love. 
      And we all feel alone at some point to some degree. Ironically, in that sense, none of us are alone. We are united in our perceived lack of unity. So next time you're feeling alone, know you stand with millions of others who are also feeling alone. And we are connected by the miracle that is sentience and the power to think and feel and it is beautiful. 
  Dear stranger, I feel alone. But I want to help you. By creating patterns out of characters on a keyboard identical to yours into a screen similiar to the one you are reading on, my words have touched your mind. Even if only for a second. And we are connected as human beings here and now. 

    Dear stranger, 
   I want you to know that I love you. Not in the way that I know the lines of your palm like mouthing the words to a childhood song I've heard thousands of times. Not in the way that the beautiful curve of your smile is carved in my heart and I know the sound of your voice and I know your favorite color and I know your favorite song and I know all the quirks that someone will fall in love with, if they haven't already. I don't know you, but I love you because you share this existance with me. If you are reading this, than you are alive on this planet at this time and you feel the things I do because we are human together. I love you like a mother loves a long-lost child. I love you like someone loves a flavor of ice cream they haven't tasted yet. 
    And I stand with the dreamers because I believe, that 
                                   someday
is the most powerful word in the english language and I believe that someday we can all find love for one another when we put down our guns and break down our walls and recognize that we are all the same. We are all human. And that is beautiful. 


So, my love, if you feel alone, take comfort in it. It means you are human and ergo:

sorry for this post probably getting a bit longer. So I (M, 23) have been a loner most of my life, I have a handful of longlasting friends, but two years ago I moved to another city for a job and therefore rarely see them, and even if I am around they are mostly busy with their girlfriends or whatever. Back then when I still lived in the same city I slowly stopped getting to attached to them as I was always feeling like the third weel and wanted to explore life like I imagine it. Since then I have been travelling alone, living alone, going to clubs alone, eating out alone, selecting hobbies that are great alone and so on.

The thing is, I agree that this type of freedom with pizza, netflix and joggers is nice for a certain time and I never had a problem with it. But  slowly I am realizing that I often feel lonely on weekends, as I would love to do more things beside getting pizza, watching movies and playing videogames for the rest of the day, but then I realize you often need friends for certain things to actually be fun – I mean sure you can go to a club on your own (just an example), but anytime I tried it I ended up getting some drinks, standing at the bar watching people having fun and then left as it felt akward to dance alone.

So what can I do to fill my weekends that is actually fun where I can maybe also meet new people? I feel like I am wasting life at this point, working during the week, making plans for the weekend only to realize there's actually noone there to share the fun with. My colleagues are just colleagues, and otherwise it's really difficult to be welcomed into a group if you're always doing things on your own ... any suggestions are highly appreciated :/",lonely,lostintimee,2019/04/06

I returned to school Jan 2018 after getting prescribed Adderall  + a larger dose of Welbutrin while away - luckily I had access to the school's psychiatrist who kept the prescriptions going for the duration. I was finally beginning to build a life for myself: made a lot of meaningful relationships, got serious about art-making, etc.

But yeah, after graduation my sessions with the psych ended. I still have enough Welbutrin to treat depression... but have been out of Adderall for a few weeks now. This is the time for job hunting, so I can shatter my reliance on my parents who financially carried me through all of this. And since my 26th birthday's in April, every day contains a bit of dread about INSURANCE.

6809,anxiety,"Newbie Here I’ve come to realize that for the last 13 yrs I’ve struggled with social anxiety (self diagnosed). My biggest symptoms are nausea and feeling like I need to go potty (maybe TMI, haha). I literally am not hungry when I’m around people, because I have anxiety (butterflies), and then when I get home and my anxiety leaves, I realize I’m starving. I’m constantly tired because I spend so much energy worrying. Some days I struggle to get up and out of bed. I like to be around people, but struggle with enforcing boundaries, I’m overly concerned with how people feel and don’t want to hurt, offend or come across as rude. I tend to freeze when I’m in uncomfortable situations, and then get upset with myself later because I wasn’t authentic and didn’t stand up for myself or speak my truth. I’m posting this in hopes of learning from all you experts in the field!! I’m super excited to have found this group. 

What books, podcasts, blogs do you recommend?

What techniques work best for you? If you’ve gone to a psychiatrist, what things did they say or recommend that helped?

Favorite meditation apps?

I’m in my mid 20’s (M) I always wanted one thing when I was younger (16)- to enlist in the Marine Corps. Turned down relationships, turned down money from family to focus on that. It was hard enough to focus on it when I had lost my brother not long beforehand. He and I were never close up until recently it started to change before he died, we never got that chance. I still think about it, obviously. Some days are worse than others. Back to enlisting - I was over 300lbs at 16 which took years to get in the shape I needed to. All at the same time was trying to get a tattoo waiver. After over 4 years of waiting from starting the process of talking to them I finally enlisted. I served 2 years and around then my mental state was shit. I started drinking every weekend, spending those weekends at strip clubs wasting money bc of my mental state. I ruined relationships &amp; had my closest friend walk out on me because of that. Eventually lead to me cutting &amp; having suicidal thoughts which caused me to be separated from the Corps. 

During that whole time I lost multiple friends, ruined those relationships lost the only thing in my life I ever worked my ass off for and spent years working towards. This ultimately made me feel worse. The downward spiral didn’t really stop for awhile. I did cut more, I drank more. Lost more close friends, pushed people away. Gained weight back and ultimately still feel like shit. I feel a huge emptiness in my life losing something I wanted so badly. And I feel like I fucked it up, that I didn’t try hard enough or something. Now, I find it hard to find something worth waking up to. Some days I really wish I didn’t. 

The only positive thing that’s happened since I’ve been home is that when I came home, I got a German Shepherd puppy. She’s the most amazing dog and I believe is the only reason I’m still here &amp; she holds me up quite a bit. I love her and value her more than myself. 

Still, I feel so lonely. I understand that people work, people are busy, in no way do I expect to be talking to someone all day or everyday. But, those who are “in” my life now, I just have had my limit of trying reach out and try to talk. I don’t want to sound selfish by any means but when nobody ever reaches out, it adds so much to the empty feeling. It sucks

TL:DR - I’ve fucked up friendships, I’ve lost friendships for no fault at mine. I lost what I worked so hard for in life &amp; now feel empty and don’t want anything else. Some days I wish I wouldn’t wake up honestly. 

I don’t know what I’m looking to get out of posting here. Not looking for advice, or some inspirational talk or anything. Just wanted to get that off my chest I guess and feel a little less lonely in doing so.",lonely,gsdowner03,2019/08/17

16805,lonely,"I feel pressured... Hi! 22 M, and I feel pressured in all aspects in life.

Back story, I've been a victim of bullying from grade school to college. I'm an introvert, I don't like talking that is not interesting for me. I don't like having more friends because I treasure the quality of friendship, not the quantity. In high school, I discovered myself that I am good at drawing/making art. So when there had an art project/drawing, they're went to make them an art. I feel that I am used to have their grades. And every time that has a major event (like NBA Finals and a movie release, particular the Marvel ones), they talked about it, and no one wanted to talk to me because I'm not interested at it.

In college, I discovered (again) that I am good at video editing/photography/graphic design. So, when the project comes, they choose me as a member of their group, sometimes a leader. I feel that I'm used again 'coz after the project finishes, no one wanted to make friends with me.

One time, I had a crush on my classmate, and I'm happy that I make friends with her. But after 2 months, she is very cold to me. I've just found out that her friends influence her. They make sure that we will not be together. Also, they sent me very long messages on facebook citing that there are many reasons why should we go in a relationship. I was really upset 'coz I built a good relationship with the girl and because of her friends' influence, it pop like a bubble.

They graduated on time, and I'm still here at university. I deleted all of my social media accounts for not being jealous on their success.  It makes me toxic. And now, my family is questioning me when do I have a romantic relationship? What's my plan? Do I still have friends? What job do I take? I feel pressured, and depressed. Every night, I can't sleep because of overthinking. *""Why are the bullies is more successful than me?""* I cried a lot every time I remember my past. I experience more mental breakdowns than before. I don't know what to do in my life. I just want to be happy and successful and I don't know where to start. I don't have **strong** support system. I don't like my daily routine now.

Anyways, I've been treated with Concerta for my ADHD - Inattentive since I was 14. I'm currently a junior in college studying Journalism.

I've been taking my current dosage (54 mg Concerta XR) for almost a year now. Recently I feel like I haven't gotten the benefit out of it that I used to. 

I feel heavy mood swings, sometimes I'll feel euphoric and able to do anything, an hour later I'll feel so mentally fogged that I can't think of a single task to accomplish, so I'll end up sitting on my phone bc i'm too overwhelmed with tasks. 

I also have a terrible comedown from the meds. Does this happen to many people? Around 9-10 hours after taking it I just feel mentally drained, like my brain is a burnt out star. I'll be happy and energetic, but too tired to do any meaningful task.

After taking Ritalin between age 7 and my teen years, then moving to taking anywhere from 18mg to 108mg Concerta not missing more than a single day at a time between my teens and age 30 I had a horrific thought: 'What if the person I am on meds isn't who I really am off meds?'  I also realized I was worried I would not know how to be any form of adult without the meds after that long.

I took a genetic test and found out no ADHD meds are considered ideal for me and all would likely have at least moderate side effects.  I have apparently been metabolizing Concerta extremely rapidly so it was probably not doing as much as I had thought.

I was so afraid to start this, but I forgot to fill my meds before the 4-Day holiday for Christmas this year.  So no matter what, I was going to run out of meds and break my long-running streak.  I decided to say screw it, and went med free and the transition was surprisingly smooth...  I had so many adverse side effects and I didn't even know it...  So coming off the meds actually feels better most of the time for me so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, today is **Day 17** of going med free and I have noticed lots of positive changes along with some challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

**Positives:**

* Feeling more creative
* IBS is finally gone!
* Only one panic attack in 2 weeks
* More emotionally aware (could be considered a negative sometimes too)
* No more fluttery heart feeling
* Goofier and more care-free (this is what I recall my natural state being before meds anyways)
* No awful MPH crash!
* I'm actually hungry in the morning and for lunch
* I can drink coffee without screwing up my meds!
* Better sleep since stopping
* More flexible than I was on Concerta...
* So much less social anxiety

**Negatives:**

* Less Focused
* Need to suddenly build out my ADHD toolbox (externalizing executive function)
* Forgetting things often
* Misplacing my damn wallet! (seriously I need to figure this out soon, it's happened three times this week before work)
* Tired lately, I can barely read without feeling my body pump out a bunch of sleep inducing hormones...
* A primal urge to seek out dopamine inducing activities, but what's new about that?

7116,anxiety,"How To Un-Tighten Your Chest When Anxious So, I know that, at least for me, chest tightness is a big symptom of anxiety. Not so much panic attacks, just anxiousness that can lead up to a panic attack. It feels as though I can't breathe enough, like I can't take in a full breath. This only makes me even more anxious. Lucky for me, it comes up a lot, so I've come up with a way to get rid of that feeling AND calm myself down. 

It's really very simple: just don't breath really deeply. I know it feels like you absolutely have to in order to survive, but trust me, you're fine. Take regular breaths. They WILL feel shallow and like you're suffocating but I promise you you're not. Do this for at least a minute or two and try taking a deep breath again. It should feel like a normal full breath. If it doesn't, stay calm and just keep breathing normally until the next time you take a deep breath and it feels normal. 

This really helps me when my chest feels tight, and focusing on my breathing simultaneously calms my nerves. I know a lot of you have probably already figured this out, but I know that I first came here for tips like this that would have been SO much easier if someone had just told me.

The anxiety has been hanging out for a couple of weeks. Because it frequently changes, it’s been more intrusive than usual this time.

18887,mindfulness,"I need help please Hello guys, ""short story"", i have had ocd since last april but never knew (harm ocd), i have always tried to reassure myself saying that i was just stressed out and it was only anxiety (got out from a half a year where i was into derealization last february). So i have never faced the thoughts and never wanted to because they go against my morals and i was a little bit scared by them because at the beggining my anxiety told to myself: Ah you cant have those, you must be suicidal or must have some serious mental illness, so this brought me to always check if i had some symptoms of the worst illness. 

In September it seemed that i had find the way to let them go by just saying to myself that they were just thoughts, after 2 months of flawless amazing life, i had an anxiety attack in a club (like derealized again) and from there everything went downhill. I was fucking tired of it that i just surrended to the fact that it will be forever but i never thought of doing suicide or some other bs , but because of the way my brain/ocd makes me react to certain emotion/sensations i thought about that. In that moment i realized that i dont want to be in pain anymore because life is amazing even if sometimes its a bitch. So now i have been 4 days into mindfulness and im understanding the mechanism of ocd and this is helping me understanding my thoughts and that the material doesnt matter and that i dont have to judge a sensation or a thought right away to fell ok with myself. Last thing is that i keep getting like a shaky head or muffled head feeling after meditation or when i hang out with my friends in general and of course my ocd told me that it was depression even if its impossible because i dont feel depressed and didnt find any symptom on the internet =DD.

19147,mindfulness,"Any kind of meditation helps you combat suffering and grow, but breath and body meditations are very important. Someone asked a few days ago how do you reconcile different methods of meditation, like focusing on the breath, and paying attention to the thought/feelings that arises.

I believe that in the end, all kinds of meditation are essentially the same. The essence of meditation is presence, the effort of bringing your attention to present sensations. Your thoughts and emotions are also a sensation in the present, just like your breath. This is why you don't have to be sitting down or in a certain pose or doing something specific to meditate, you can be running focusing on the sensations of hitting the ground and your muscles contracting, washing dishes paying attention to the cold water running though your hands and the shine of the plates as you twist and turn them, driving and noticing all the intricacies going on in other cars or the street, anything that is turning your attention to the present is meditation.

I believe this is in fact the only way we can learn anything or grow as people, if you're present during reading it just means you're paying attention to the words and their meaning, paying attention to the people you care about and feeling empathy as a result for them, paying attention to your thoughts and learning to manage them and use them in a better way.

So this is why paying attention to just your breath is sometimes so good, because you learn to live without anything else but your breath. It's letting go of everything else but one thing, that you'll always have and will always be there. Paying attention the the sensation of your heart beating, or your body awareness (the way you know where your hands are even if you can't see them), etc.

In the end, it's all about choosing to live in the present, and with that comes the realization that you never need anything else that what it's offering to you.",mindfulness,The_Dr_B0B,2018/11/09

I've felt all week that time has been moving so fast, to the point where I can't focus on what I'm doing or what people are saying. I've been feeling constantly irritable and pent up, and I burst out into tears today in the office, which is rare for me. I guess everything just built up over time.

5050,adhd,"How did you figure out what you actually enjoy doing? This may seem like an odd question (or maybe not), and I wonder how much of it was due to my being diagnosed so late in life.

Anyway, I have a *really hard* time predicting whether I'll enjoy something or not.  Even when I find something that I enjoy for the moment, it's even money whether I'll just hit this point somewhere in the middle and have no clear idea why I had any interest in whatever it is.  Meds make this happen less often, but far from never.  It's also really inconsistent in another way: I can have something I really liked to do for a time just suddenly stop having any appeal.

I've been reading a little about the concept of salience as it applies to brain function, and more specifically *incentive* salience.  Dopamine seems to be involved in this process, and of course dopamine levels are implicated in ADHD.   For example, a study I found from 1998 hypothesizes that dopamine is involved in converting a purely mental concept into an object of motivation.  The authors also mention that other researchers had suggested that dopamine is involved in mediating reward-learning somehow, and/or the ability to predict that something will be rewarding ""based on associative correlations.""  (I don't want to overstate my understanding of brain chemistry, so I say all this only to draw the connection between ADHD and incentive salience.)

I've heard that ADHD can mess up the desire-reward connection, but I always kind of assumed that it was in terms of result, i.e. that it could make you not feel good about having done something that you wanted to do.  At the least, I think there's more going on, even if that isn't itself inaccurate.

Instead, I'm beginning to wonder if I'm not getting a lot of false positives, so to speak.  In other words, I wonder if I'm getting motivational signals from my brain that are directing me towards a reward that I don't actually care about.  For example, I can imagine cleaning a room, and I like the idea of it *being* clean, but the idea of actually doing it sounds horrifying.  But it's like I can only feel one or the other.  I can't make that connection to ""yes it will suck to do, but it will be worth it when it's done.""  It never feels like the payoff will be worth the energy expenditure.  Maybe this is an example of that whole executive functioning thing?

Meanwhile, I'm also thinking that perhaps the fact that boredom is so uncomfortable unmedicated (i.e. most of my life) means that the only real incentive I ever learned for anything is ""will it stop me from being bored for the next 2 minutes?""

The result seems to be that I haven't the faintest idea what I actually want to achieve with my life, or really how I want to spend my time.  I just sort of sit here and hope that I can find some way to kill time for the moment, and that I'll then be able to find something else when that wears off.  I can sometimes make longer-term goals, but they don't go past ""do this thing that will take awhile,"" and I virtually never maintain interest long enough to actually finish.  By way of example, I was looking at the [""toolbox""](https://howtoadhd.com/toolbox/) put out by How to ADHD.  One of the sheets they have there is called ""Goal Setting,"" and it asks what's really important and what we want out of our lives, and then gives a bunch of categories such as job, romantic partner, etc. 

I haven't the foggiest idea how to answer any of those.  I mean, I could give some vague platitudes, like saying that I want a job that is ""fulfilling,"" but I couldn't begin to say what that actually means.

Sometimes, meds do help with this.  But even then, it's less that my purpose is clear and more that it doesn't seem to matter that it isn't.

I should add that I've also been diagnosed with dysthymia, and so some degree of anhedonia is probably a contributing factor.

To be clear, it's less that I don't know in and of itself and more that I don't even know how to start figuring it out.",adhd,stjer0me,2019/07/12

Its 2am and I can't sleep cause my mind is running all over the place and after a bit of talking with myself I came to this conclusion that I wanted to talk to someone and get an outsiders opinion, okay so

Everyone has this voice in their head, constantly, forever. This voice tells you how to act, tells you what to say, tells you how to feel. This voice. Is you. Its your conscience. Life is an endless conversation with yourself. As your reading these words off of this screen, they are being read in your head, in your voice. Now that your self aware of that little voice in your head you can notice it more. You can stop and think ""damn theres actually a voice in my head"" 
Now when you are around people, this voice, is filtered. Whether around friends, family, or strangers, this voice in your head is constantly telling you how to act based on who your with. Be funny. Tell a joke. Small talk. Dont do anything weird. 
Its also processing all the information it is being given around it. The thing is. No one can hear your voice. No one can read your thoughts. No matter who you are with, they will never know what you are thinking. That voice in your head is private. It has the freedom of expressing itself however it wants in your head because no one can see it. When you judge someone and think to yourself ""damn they look ugly with that new haircut"" you know they can't hear that voice, but out of respect you dont tell them that, you give them a lil compliment and move along with your day.
Ok so.
When you are entirely alone. Completely by yourself. Home alone with the certainty that no one is around and no one is watching. You are in private.
That little voice in your head, no longer has to be filtered. 
It has the freedom to physically and verbally express itself. 
It is the realist version of you. 
And it only shows when you are alone. 
Everyone acts different once behind closed doors because they no longer have anything holding them back. 
No one knows the real you. Only you do.
Only you know how you act when you are alone. 
Because thats when your true conscience shows.
So my wondering is, does a constant, more time alone, (although not good for the mental healty) allow you to learn more about who you are, become more at peace with yourself, and if possible, allow you to mature into who you truly are?  Or something? Idk",lonely,this_one_artist,2019/08/08

4463,adhd,"Not diagnosed...yet I am a 32 year old male and have only recently become aware that I may have ADHD. After talking with a friend of mine about the things I feel, it made me realise that I am completely not normal, and that others don’t suffer what I’ve been going through for a number of years.

I noticed this change started about 5-7 years ago, but never really knew what it was, and got too distracted to even research it (oh, the irony). Basically, I find it difficult to concentrate on tasks, and am often skipping between tasks trying to settle in to what I’m going to actually do for the day, instead of just doing a task. Some days I’ll start work, and won’t have got much done by lunch time, because I’ve spent the whole morning analysing each task that needs to be done and which one has the highest priority. This happens so often, that I can’t actually get anything done. I am very easily distracted, to the point that right now I’m hearing my wife’s conversation with my son in the other room and can’t even remember what I was going to type now. 

I also think I may have some autism markers too. I get sensory overload. For example, my family and I were at a cafe today and there were so many noises going on and in the end I just had to shut my ears with my hands and close my eyes. I could hear the noises of the coffee grinder, my daughter crying, my wife telling me what coffee she wanted, whilst trying to remember everyone’s order, whilst hearing a car revving it’s engine outside and many many more things. It was all too much and I just shut down.

My lapsing concentration is affecting my quality of my work, and since I have my own business, it’s a huge problem for me. There have been days where I’ve managed to get absolutely nothing done at all, because I was skipping between tasks that much. I would start a task, realise that I was supposed to finish another task, then realise that I needed to call my wife, then realised that I needed to sort out the insurance paperwork from 2 weeks ago, then remembered that my daughter needed to be somewhere on Tuesday, oh and Tuesday was tomorrow, which meant that I needed to get some work done today because I would be taking the day off tomorrow, oh no but it’s already mid day and I haven’t achieved anything....you get the picture.

Like I said, I haven’t been diagnosed as yet and haven’t even seen a psychologist about it but will make an appointment tomorrow if I don’t get distracted.

My plan to make new friends went horribly wrong and I really thought I could have changed things by going from having no friends to atleast one or two but now I just dont wanna show my face to those classes.,anxiety,DNotorious_BIG,2019/09/05

18767,mindfulness,"What is financial mindfulness to you? I have been practicing mindfulness for years and it has helped me overcome some of my deepest anxieties and has allowed me to move forward in life with intention.

Recently I was reading that Americans are more stressed about money than relationships and work combined. I personally know that anxiety can lead to avoidant behaviors without the right guidance. I started talking to a friend about how we use our knowledge of mindfulness to build better financial practices. In the end, we decided that we wanted to build something akin to a budgeting app that deeply integrated mindfulness principles and helped people be present with their finances. 

So my question is this, what would that look like to you? What would you like to see built into a financial app that best embodied mindfulness to you? Would you ever use something like that?",mindfulness,vapor2020,2019/08/25

4244,adhd,"Resources for developing coping strategies? In the last few weeks, I have been going through the process of figuring out if I have ADHD, and whether it is medically significant. I live in Sydney and I have been to a psychologist who referred me to a GP so that I could be referred to a psychiatrist, who is now referring me back to a GP so that I can be referred to a ADHD specialist. I can’t afford to pay for a specialist at the moment even with the medicare rebate, so I am hoping that a bulk-billing specialist will take me, though the psychiatrist who referred me has said that it will be unlikely. The people I have talked to have stated that I am likely to have some form of attention deficiency, though I will not be able to determine the severity of this for some time.

I have booked another appointment with the psychologist to try to figure out some non-medical treatment methods in the likely event that I will not be able to see a specialist, but this will be several weeks from now. I am hoping that I can get a head start on some behavioural methods to help me cope with losing attention and focus, and forgetting things, and misbehaving in social situations. I have had some success so far simply by being mindful of the times when my mind is drifting away and forcing myself to refocus, which has allowed me to actually sit through two lectures so far without losing focus (with the help of coffee). It is likely though that this habit will slip as I stop paying attention to my own behaviours. I haven’t been able to figure out good strategies in social situations. I’ve been trying to look at the person speaking and trying really hard to pay attention and not daydream, but I end up forgetting what they say anyway. Also with regards to work, I haven’t developed good strategies for keeping myself on task and being mindful of the time available.

Therefore, I am interested in finding guides that will alow me to take a more structured approach to dealing with my problems. I have gotten my hands on the Hallowell books and have watched some of the videos posted here, but I’m looking for something more direct than that. Something like a recipe book would be great, like steps to deal with common issues. Perhaps I’m not far enough into the Hallowell books and he does detail some of these, but I was wondering if there are more resources and guides that people have used to develop coping strategies.

Lately I am starting to doubt the benefits of my practice, let me explain:

I started practicing mindfulness around 2010 and really enjoyed and benefited from it at first. But now I feel like I've lost desire to really achieve anything because nothing external matters much to me anymore. 

I feel blissed whenever I can just feel my body, be still, and notice the amusing things that go on around me, birds, clouds, people passing by, thoughts or motions in my body, but it has become a problem in my day to day functioning. I have things to do (like looking for work since I'm unemployed and moved back into my parents house) but I honestly don't feel any sort of urgency/motivation/desire to act. 

I am starting to believe that I would be fine if I ever became homeless, thinking  it wouldn't be so bad, whatever happens happens and things like that.. and I have been trying to force myself out of this feeling of wanting to be idle through action (working out, socializing and forcing myself to do things) but I keep coming back to this ""why do I have to do anything anyway? Why can't I just stare at this wall and enjoy my presence?""

Especially people that can’t understand or don’t know how to love,because it’s confusing it’s a lot it’s hard to love yourself so only imagine how it is to love somebody else truly. i have never had a problem understanding my own love it’s understanding other people’s love and how they perceive another’s love. i understand in all its simplicity how i love people and why and how that love comes about. I am able to love other people as it is the same to breathe,i am able to love myself subconsciously but it is hard for people to love me, it’s hard maybe cause i put myself out of reach,i don’t allow people to understand me. i don’t think or act how the majority does i always say i think i’m before myself,i feel stuck like i’m in the wrong place all the time. The way i love is first through affirmation,i’m too loyal to  disloyalty this is my biggest mistake. Then it is the semi attachment obtained from hours upon hours of endless talking and conversation in one time because one doesn’t simply do this because they are bored it because it means something? incorrect this is my second mistake people are unpredictable,sly and manipulative characteristics someone like me fails to see as i only see the best in people even if it means i have to invent it myself. People can pretend for the fun of it or to gain something out of it. this i know all to well because when loving or feeling i have always been put in the same position different exterior same interior, each boy with a different look each with the same intent and goal. For there has never been one boy who has kept me and solely me in their heart,i have never been anything but 2nd best. I am nothing more than someone to pass the time with until something better comes along, this has broken my heart too many times for me to feel,i will admit i don’t feel love because why would you when it only proves to be destructive why would you want to feel that so i turned that feeling off believe it or not. i stopped falling for words,i stopped falling for actions. i stopped falling. Instead i followed, i followed back on the words i followed the actions i reciprocated in a way as to keep up appearances. i saw the wolf dressing up in the sheep’s outfit and i did nothing but go along with it’s actions until the day it would decide to undress. because all wolfs get tired of sheep’s clothing especially when they meet something else. It was just a case of seeing who could hold out the longest my mask or my feelings. When the wolf begun to start undressing which didn’t take long it didn’t hurt i didn’t feel anything but anger,angry that a wolf could think they deceived me a wolf running and screaming to the mountains it deceived me when it was not me  that was deceived but the wolf, i let you think you had me and that you played when it was me that was going off on you,laughing at the things you would say,rolling my eyes. not even slightly amazed at the actions you put together. i over analyse and create patterns that aren’t apparent i do this and go off this. I wish i hadn’t been broken so much times,the more you break something the more and more it fails to work as it did,i fear loneliness because that’s what this does to me the fear of not being able to trust,not being able to feel,how can you form a connection with someone you can’t feel for or can’t trust because at all costs you cannot afford to get broken again because you cannot guarantee to yourself that you will still function, what an upsetting cycle it is for someone who longs to be loved that can never be loved. Someone who cannot have a guard up as every person is ‘different’ and will offer something new and the bombardments of what if. what if this one is the one i mustn’t shut him out in fear he will only look else where. This is how i love and can never be loved. His words echo in my mind. “There is no one for you “ it repeats in a dead tone in the front of my mind. “there is no one for” a destroying sentence in itself, there is not a single person in the world in the great mass of people not one person will be compatible for me, this isn’t a stranger saying this to me it is at the time my boyfriend whom i’ve loved for 3 years and been with for a year the boy who told me he wanted a future with me is the same boy who told me no one is compatible for me. not even himself and this wasn’t said in a way as i am so superior nobody deserves my love or can even level me it was said in a way that i should spend the rest of my life alone because i do not deserve to love anybody. this was said with nothing but malice and anger. i don’t trust words or actions so how do you plan to prove you love me for real and how do you expect me to fall for you",lonely,alxshai,2019/10/02

A couple of years ago I was in a bad relationship, didn't quite realise it. He is a mechanic and the first time we went driving I pulled up to a junction and he screamed 'WOAH WOAH WOAHHH' thinking someone had died, I slammed on the brakes and said what? He was warning me there was a junction, okay...

I had a feeling there was something wrong with my car, no one believed me. Mechanic boyfriend basically gaslighted me for 2 years, turns out it had a twisted chassis frame and was unsafe. Once I found out the actual problem I think the anxiety started, no matter what car I drove. And it was a compound of life issues: I wasn't having a great time at college, as I said, relationship sucked, my brother died, submitting a thesis, CSA counselling etc... My therapist actually laughed at me when I told him my problem last year, even though there are sooo many underlying issues.

3 years of this and I have been terrified of highways and basically any road I have to go past 50mph on. If I'm having a bad day, I'm useless and will literally take an hour extra to get somewhere if it avoids highways.

However! At the start of this week, I drove 40 miles on the highway at the proper speed and another 120 cross country with reasonable confidence. Yesterday I did 170!!! I had a hire car and it was nice to drive, which probably made the difference but I DID IT.

I had a bunch of digital coupons, so it took me extra time to make sure I was getting the right things under the promotions.  I finally got up to the checkout and there was an older lady (40s/50s) and her mother behind me in line. Things were a little slow today and I could hear them talking about how annoying it was that everything was taking a long time.

Here’s where it started to go downhill for me. My total was higher than it should have been so I asked if my coupons came off. The cashier said that they hadn’t and suggested I might not have clipped them correctly (I did). The lady behind me laughs.  I tell the cashier that I got several items BECAUSE I had the coupons and the lady scoffs/laughs in a nasty way. The cashier tells me to just cash out and take it up with customer service. I go to pay and my debit card can’t cover the total (embarrassing) so she asks if I can pay with another card. And this awful lady behind me mutters “offffff course...” and scoffs again. Her mom shushes her. I want to melt into the floor.

Because I didn’t have enough money I felt like it was even more important that I get my coupon money (like $15!) so I did go to customer service, go over it line by line, and get my money.

(Although she claims we are best friends now)  This crushed my spirit I don't even feel like talking to her anymore but sometimes I miss her . It's just so confusing that and taking a toll on my mental health that I can't even talk to other girls at this point.,lonely,dabble7,2019/07/01

Low down on me.
Im 19 from australia, i have ADD ADHD and depression and anxiety. 
Im on 72mg of concerta( the highest dose you can have in australia) and setralin for my depression.
Also i have tried ritalin but makes me hyper agressive, ive also been diagnosed since about the age of 6.

Now i still live at home and over the last year ive been struggling more to keep my pearents happy, with things like finishing chores, or remembering to do them. 
Is it partly because im so burnt out from focusing( or at least trying to) all day.

I will add that moving out isnt a viable option as i cant handle my money well enough and mum and dad only charge me 160 a fortnight for rent.",adhd,surgeonerindustries,2019/04/25

19575,mindfulness,"My experience with social anxiety and mindfulness For context, I have been practicing meditation for around 6 months starting off rather inconsistently but making it a daily practice within the last 2 months. I also suffer from social anxiety, some days much more than others. 
I wouldn't say it has cured or eliminated my social anxiety. Rather it's given me a space (for lack of a better word) between the anxiety that arises and how I react to it. Before practicing I would become socially anxious as I still do now which would lead me down this downward spiral of negative thoughts and rumination. I would be in my head for the next 30 minutes just wondering what the other person is thinking of me now. This in turn led me to be even more anxious and taciturn for the rest of the day. 
Now when my social anxiety arises, I will admit that initially I still get those racing thoughts but very quickly I become aware of what's happening in my mind. I don't fight it. I just accept that my mind is uncomfortable and that it's all in my head. I take a deep breath and ground myself to the present, and I start paying more attention to what the other person is saying rather than what my monkey mind is telling me. 
I almost see my mind as this different entity in my head. It's weird. Anyways I just hope that anyone else that has to deal with social anxiety can benefit from this. I think instead of suffering from S.A we can choose to accept it and live with it.",mindfulness,brownhippy8,2019/10/05
18999,mindfulness,"Thoughts of the psyche Consciousness refers to our awareness of our own mental processes, such as our thoughts, feelings, and sensations. I consider this awareness to be our ability for rationality.

Unconsciousness refers to the source of these processes, which include our thoughts, feelings, and sensations. I consider these to be the source of irrationality.

Consciousness can also be considered as intellect and intuition, while unconsciousness can be considered as feeling and sensation.

Consciousness can be symbolized by a crystal, when you hold a crystal up to any surrounding area you are able to see the image of that area within the crystal itself, giving awareness of reality.

Unconsciousness on the other hand can be symbolized as filters held in front of that crystal of consciousness, they show you the same image but in a different light. 

For me I can see clearly as a crystal at times of my existence, which in turn, lets me understand that I can also see through the filters of my emotion, feeling, thoughts, delusion and any other of my unconscious states. Which have the power to either clog or enhance the view of reality.

When the states of evil or discomfort start to become the filter of the crystal, it is not going to be helpful to try escape those filters by moving towards a different more favorable one, although, what will be beneficial is to no longer see through the filter, but to see the filter itself in front of the crystal, only then will you have the ability to accept it (the clogging state of unconsciousness) and let it go. In this way, you no longer have to escape any state, but have the ability to let the state escape you.

6502,anxiety,"My recipe for a healthier mindset On mobile, so forgive formatting issues.

This is a sequence of positive affirmations that I have come up with over time, and recently strung together to form a series of reminders that can lead me towards a more easeful state of mind. They serve as a healthy note to self and as a tool for grounding myself whenever I'm feeling anxious. I'm posting it in the hopes that it can help others like it helps me. If anyone has their own pearls of wisdom to share then please do. Let's all build each other up.

My recipe:

Thoughts are just trains of association that get triggered by internal and external events. Your emotions affect your thoughts and vice versa. Don't treat all thoughts as your own; irrational and intrusive thoughts/perspectives exist.

Some trains of thought can become habitual loops/grooves in our thinking. If they are unhelpful you can choose not to engage with them, and instead make room for new grooves to form over time.

Anxious trains of thought tend to be messy, entangled and circular. They aren't worth delving into because you can't think your way out of them. Recognise that no matter how important something feels to think about, if it comes from a place of irrational anxiety, it's not worth it. If it's really such an important issue the problem will still be there for you to think about tomorrow. You don't have to go into it right now.

Don't only be mindful of your thoughts; be mindful of your attitudes towards them too. Don't be fearful of, or judge yourself for having, certain trains of thought; it only fuels panic. Remember that it's okay to feel this. Everyone has their problems and insecurities. Know that things come and go, everything changes, and the good times are as much an indicator of how things can be as the bad times. Things will change if you let them and stop struggling with them.

You have a whole story of self that influences your behaviours, but you can choose to ignore this story anytime you wish. You can respond instead of reacting. You don't have to relate everything back to your anxiety. You can change your habitual thought patterns and perspectives on life.

Remember that there is a lot that goes through your head, you can't take it all seriously. 

Know that eventually you will learn the lesson, and wonder why you gave yourself such a hard time along the way.",anxiety,3flowersmaybemore,2019/06/25

On air flowing down to your lungs? On that particular feeling in your nose? On all of those? Or on just the fact you are breathing?

And with that out of the way, when your mind starts to ""wander"", when still focusing on your breathing, how do you observe your thoughts if you are focusing on your breathing?

This one is quite irrelevant - how do you experience your thoughts? I found out when I'm in ""normal mode"", my thoughts are somewhat like a conversation or a monologue.

After a terrible panic attack, bordering on psychosis, i had to move back in with my parents. That was a year ago and nothing has changed, in fact it has gotten worse.

I despise the people that say, if you need help, get it, there are so many resources out there. They obviously havent been through what we'eve been through. Sure there's resources, a psychiatrist that takes 3 months to get into, a neurologist that takes 6, multiple therapists who dont click with you. I've tried pills, many of them, and nothing has worked. I've tried EMDR, nothing. Nuero feedback, the worker told me my brain didnt adapt to it.

I've asked him about it a few times but he avoids it, claims he's fine and turns it around by asking what's wrong with me.

I've been out of work and college for the last five years due to some severe illness. When I was in school I never learned to study - literally couldn't make myself sit down to do it for more than five minutes at a time before getting distracted or wandering off. I kind of just coasted through.

My last job was great for me in some ways, insofar as I had a million different tasks so if something was burning me out or I was losing attention, I'd just switch task for awhile - and it'd still be something productive. I do the same with cleaning my house (though I'm still not great at it, I've gotten better) - I'll start with dishes, get distracted halfway through, end up clearing counters, organising stuff, then end up on laundry, maybe back to dishes - it kind of gets cleaned in a mishmash of a spiral of my brain hopping from place to place but if I keep at it eventually everything gets done. (If I don't, it somehow ends up as more of a mess!)

Anyway, recently due to my health issues I've started doing some transcription work online. However... I can't fucking focus on it. It's not something I can doodle while I listen to, it's not something I can throw on an episode in the background to while I work - I have to focus on it, and it alone, to do it. It's driving me mad and leading me to more and more procrastination in getting it done and I missed a deadline last week as a result.

I'm also doing a course online as well, and I'm having similar issues with studying. I've tried *so goddamned many* studying guides but again, my attention - POOF. Just fucking POOF. I'm so goddamned scatterbrained I don't even realise always when I've tuned out and missed half a damned lecture - let alone sitting down to study!

Was traveling to a 5am job interview one day, skipped morning breaksfast / toilet break to arrive on time. Unfortunately pooped myself as I pulled into the job interview and had an awkward encounter. Managed to clean up and had a spare pair of underwear in the car and went about the job interview. During the trial, I had to use the rest room multiple times and just felt sick so I decided to go home.  


All was fine and tried again at the same place a few days later, managed to get there with no issues. But during the trial, felt sick again and had to go home - No excessively toilet usage.   


This was 3 months ago, since then I've been constantly anxious and can barely leave my house. Every time I have to leave, I get terrible knots in my stomach and have to use the rest room and once I'm driving I get terrible bouts of panic and anxiousness and need to find the nearest restroom.   


Last week I went to a psychiatrist and was put on 7.5mg of Miratazapine. I've noticed they've given me the ability to sleep without overthinking and quieted down my anxiety slightly but still unable to leave the house without symptoms. I've now moved up to 15mg and not feeling much different.   


Some days I'm able to drive for \~30 minutes and push through my anxiety and symptoms and other days like when I had my psych appointment, I had to pull over half way there in an 8km drive and duck into a fast food resturant to use the toilet. I'm not sure how to expain it, but I know I'm getting anxious over nothing in my head but symptoms just come on and I can't push through them like I have previously in life.  


So far I've changed my diet completely, getting plenty of fibre in, working out regularly, fixed my sleeping, getting plenty of sun and taking multi vitamins (vit D, b12, fish oil and a probiotic). This is literally ruining my life, I've been out of work and eating through savings to pay bills, unable to keep up with friends or do anything a normal person would.  


  
The Psychiatrist thinks I have - Social Anxiety, Generalised Anxiety and a Panic Disorder. I've had practically a parent die and two cousins pass away in under a year and a half, so he thinks this could have helped trigger this. I'm looking to see a psychologist as soon as possible.  Any words of encouragement or previous experiences? Please. Thank you.

17089,lonely,"What now? Hey guys and gals

I am not really sure why I am even starting this as I'm normally so protective of any possible vulnerable emotion. 

I work as a first responder in a major city, in 2012 I was diagnosed with PTSD after witnessing a particularly disturbing call. I used to be a fairly out going individual and though I seem to make initial friendships, I can never form any lasting connection because I am incredibly shy and self conscious. I am not sure what has changed in me, but I feel like I'm a kind gentle person who can no longer socially connect. I find myself doing things like going to the gym or library or coffee shop just to be around other people. And as I'm now 33 I feel like I'm passing any possible chance to form a caring relationship. I am not really sure what to do... you don't make new friends at 33.. and I distanced myself from my old friends.

Anyway, I guess I could go on for 20,000 words about my problems. If there is any like minded individuals who regardless of age just want to be in contact with other humans who at times sufer from the affliction of having to be social beings, contact me!

Like I said, I am a 33 year old male, very liberal I am a pretty avid gamer so if any other lonely soles want to hang out on discord and game or watch twitch or a movie or talk about cool new science etc please let me know.

19148,mindfulness,"What are your thoughts on this? This isn't a typical mindfulness question, but I am wondering what you esteemed people have to say about this, if anything.

My friend Mike's days are going by very fast. He's recently unemployed and has savings to relax on before he gets a new job. He's not sure what new job he wants, but isn't super concerned about that. He'll get another job and continue working in some new field probably. He's more concerned with the fact that he has no idea what he's doing with his life. He had hoped that his new and long vacation would ground him somehow. That the free time might reveal what his next step should be, or what to do with his life. That he might get in touch with himself. But, it's been almost a month now and he has been playing video games all day every day non stop. His sleeping patterns are erratic, but all he does all day is play video games. He wakes up and he thinks, ""I don't really want to make today like yesterday"" But he can't get even a loose hold on what he does want his day to be like. Then, at a certain point, what feels like the same ""time"" after he woke up, but is really about 16 hours, he gets sleepy, and goes to bed, then it happens again the next day. I can't stress enough how much he really does perceive his days going by that fast. He says it's like when you're getting ready for the day, and you make breakfast, then you sit down and play a video game for a bit before you have to go in a half hour. It feels like that when he gets sleepy and has to go to bed. Like he didn't get a day. But he doesn't know what else to do. Video games are entertaining, and if he's not doing that then he's idle. He knows he's fortunate to be in the position he's in, and that he will later get a job and resume working life. But, he feels like he thinks he has lost part of himself from having worked for so many years, and that he doesn't know how to get it back, or where it is, however you say it. I don't see him making any kind of progress doing this, unless I'm mistaken. I don't know exactly what to make of it, or how to help him, or if he needs help. His situation has me questioning what I would do with a long vacation, and how adapted to work I might be that stopping, like he is, might leave me just playing video games drinking soda like him. It doesn't seem right,  it seems totally empty to distract yourself all day for weeks and weeks on end. But at the same time, he's not doing anything wrong. He eats ok, he doesn't drink or do drugs, he's hygienic, he's a nice guy. But he has like, no desire to do anything, and he's expressing that this is a bit alarming to him and he's not sure what to make of it. He's compared himself to the Buddha sitting under the tree for 40 days and 40 nights, except that he has a laptop to play video games on while he's sitting there. He means that not having desire isn't necessarily a bad thing. He doesn't have any emotional problems, he's not depressed, but he doesn't show any sign of wanting to like, improve his life. To talk to someone, go on a dating site, pick up a hobby, visit family, or anything. In a lot of ways his life is very good, but it seems empty. I wasn't sure what to tell him when he told me all this, is emptiness good or bad? Does the lack of a memories making up a day matter when you don't feel anything good or bad about it? Is not making progress ok? It seems like he's just... done. He seems at peace, but kind of like he left this world. Is he ok?",mindfulness,saltysealions,2019/08/20

17218,lonely,"Can anyone somewhat relate to my situation ?  

To start off, I am an introvert male

During my years in middle school and high school, i always wanted to have a girlfriend. As a guy, i will admit i am not a great looking guy. I have tried asking girls out and i have tried talking to girls in person and on social media. Sometimes i am successful and sometimes the conversations don't go as expected because the girl i am talking to does not want to talk to me, i struggle to keep the conversation ,the girl puts little effort to continue the conversation , or the girl i'm talking to just leaves me on read.

(I do admit that i'm not that great at talking to girls sometimes. I guess its part of me being so introverted. I also don't have a huge social life like regular people because i have a helicopter parent \[that's another topic for another day\]. So most of my social life revolves around being in church.

Fast forward to my early adult life , I'm still in the same situation. I still have not found a girlfriend . And the desire to want a girlfriend is vary strong. Whenever i talk to a girl , i feel really good about my self because she is typically enjoying the conversation and she is giving me my full attention . But moments like those rarely happen .

So to temporally satisfy my desire of having a girlfriend, i jack off to some of the pictures of the females i know in real life

Sometimes when i see a girl at an event looking sexy , i think to my self, ""dang, she is really fine, i wish i was dating you.""

17665,lonely,"Sick of Waking Up I'm fed up with being lonely. I just miss the feeling of intimacy with someone, being able to make them smile and laugh all the time. Cuddling each other to sleep and waking up to seeing each other and looking forward to sharing the day together. Having someone to love and to love you back. Now it's just close to unbearable, I hate it so much waking up to a cold, empty house. There's no memories to be made alone like this and it's just frustratingly sad waking up everyday to this. I don't have anyone that loves me, not a single friend or family member. I hate it.

I was talking to a girl when I was in a city I rarely get to go to that was really cute and had a personality I felt was really attractive which doesn't happen often for me. I just don't like the vast majority of people. When I had to go I hadn't thought to ask for her number or anything and now I feel like a dumbass because I probably won't ever see her again. I should've at least tried because at least if I got rejected I wouldn't be filled with regret. On top of that I just had a shitty date and couldn't stop thinking about that girl during it.

I was looking at pictures, and it has been making me so excited to get there it hurts. I kept walking and dancing and jumping around my room for the last 2 hours. I am not exactly nervous, but I would say REALLY happy (I haven’t felt like this in some time) but it is actually killing me.

Hey there, I've been on Concerta 54mg for a month, two months total after going up from 18 to 36 to 54 pretty quickly. I felt some benefits and some real improved mood and focus in the mornings especially when I first took it. I've written about it a little here before. But ever since being on 54 it seems my depression and anxiety, which I already have, have been so through the roof when it wears off that it's totally outweighing any benefits the Concerta might have had before. I'm also not sure that perhaps the Concerta is making me focus more on my depression.

I've seen people write before about being on too high a dose of a medication, has anyone gone back down to 36 or so and felt much better or is it just a sign that Concerta is wrong for you? I'm hesitant to add an anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication to Concerta to offset these effects when I'm not positive Concerta is really working all that well so that would be a major last resort for me.

My doctor also seems hesitant to prescribe a further IR booster to beat the crash and I probably agree wit him, as stacking medication after just a couple of months seems rash.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm a young 24 year old guy who is having trouble making any real lasting connections. Platonic, Romantic, or otherwise. I just feel a real lack of kinship with anyone my age especially. I'm a very old-school type person. I don't have a Facebook/Instagram because I feel like those sites are pretty vain. Just a pit of people either arguing or showing off. I am not into showing off or arguing. I feel like social media isn't social at all. This whole idea of ""Wow this is really helping people socialize"" is wrong. It just further separates people. While yes I have friends in a very limited wavelength, There is a hobby that I'm sorta into and all of my friends are ONLY in that hobby. It sucks. I wish I had a friend whom I shared at least 2 attributes with. I feel like for the past 5\~10 years of my life I've only had friends in a very limited sense. There is no true understanding between me and my friends in my life. Just things to do with that one particular hobby. Any attempt made by me to swerve the conversation into a more interesting direction is usually met with resistance. I have also been going to school and have very little luck meeting anyone who is on the same wavelength as I am.  I have tried dating apps too and I kinda feel like they are fundamentally flawed in the way that they are set up. They are 100% based on looks. And while I would consider myself a solid 6/10 in the looks dept. (5 being average) that still doesn't make me feel any better about the situation. That whole swipe thing is retarded I hate that system. I know I am a decent guy and everything, but  I also have trouble meeting anyone who isn't obsessed with their phone. Everyone I talk to has this weird glazed over/far away look in their eyes like they aren't even really there. Especially millennials. I've straight up walked out of restaurants because the people I'm with won't stop looking at their phone. I've even texted a few girls back and forth, and then when you try to get them to talk to you on the phone with your real voice they stop talking to you. What kind of mental ward have I been dropped off at? Because I didn't get the memo.

6439,anxiety,"Something that helpped me this morning So I have been dealing with anxiety for at least 20 years and only now am I getting help though Cognative Behavioral Therapy. I have my 3rd session today. There are a few tools he has given me that work great even when I was skeptical.

1)Breathe slowly. Breathe in for a count of 4, breathe out for a count of 6 or 7 repeat.

2) Find a phrase that helps you, something short. He said his favorite is ""Lord have mercy"" or mine, I am a Christian and I connect with this one, ""I am with you always."" Repeat the phrase to yourself over and over while breathing slowly. 

3) You can take it one step further (I didn't do this, this morning) and try to remember a memory where you felt fully and completely at peace, no anxiety, and take yourself there remember how it felt. While remembering that anxiety free moment touch a place on your body, like your wrist so that eventually all of this will make it so when you touch your wrist you go back to the calm place. Don't touch your wrist if you feel the anxiety creeping back in, only touch your wrist when you are at that place of peace. Repeat.

All three of these take time to condition yourself but it works!! I try to do 1 and 2 every day, I usually do it for 15 minutes without realizing, the time flys and I feel so calm right now. I have been. Calm for 30 minutes, I don't know how long it will last but FINALLY something works!!! 

Tl;dr. Breathe in 4 counts, breathe out 6 counts. Repeat a short, meaningful phrase over and over and over and keep going. Take yourself to a place of peace in your memory and touch your wrist when you feel calm. Repeat. ",anxiety,Ashleafs,2018/11/26

It has also accompanied anxiety, something I have never before experienced. Mindfulness helps me get a handle on my feelings of anxiety.

It's been a while since I've increased my medication dosage, and I'm noticing the effects of my daily medication are starting to be less effective; I'm having more and more days where I feel frustrated, and depressed, dissociative, and genuinely unable to get started on the things that I really *want* to do. 

I've been reading that it's good to step back and do something that you enjoy but that doesn't take up a lot of mental energy or focus. A lot of recommendations have been activities such as watching TV or reading, but I often find that if I'm having a particularly difficult ADHD day even TV is too challenging to pay attention to, leaving me just as frustrated as before and unable to recharge. Since I don't know a lot of people directly who have ADHD, it's hard not to feel alone on days when I can't help but just lay in bed frozen thinking.

Everything is pretty much catered to me. My lessons are private, 1 on 1, everything is explained to me, and my teacher understands my ADHD to a point. She's been very helpful in the past, and lenient when I haven't finished my homework. But I fear this is the last straw.

I didn't do my homework this week. I didn't know how to answer part of it, so of course my brain just gave up on the entire work instead of just doing what I could.

 I'm so tired of this. I want to be able to do the work expected of me. I want to be able to start my homework early on in the week, and I want to be able to ask for help early on so it doesn't seem like I'm doing everything last minute.

I've stopped doing things last minute. Now I don't even do things at all.

I want to stop letting down everyone around me. My parents, who saved up money for my education, whose money I'm now wasting. My mom, who goes to bat for me, who fights for my second and third chances, who just wants me to succeed.

I’ve been spending some time doing the mindfulness mediations on Sam Harris’ Wakingup app. There is a particular concept that he discusses that makes me extremely uncomfortable - he suggests focusing on the feelings of the face and head. Then mentions the idea that while many of us feel as if we exist behind our face, this isn’t really true. For example, in day 10 and 11 of the intro meditations.

Trying to do this causes something close to panic rise up in me. Like I have an itch I can’t scratch, or am trapped in a tiny space I can’t get out. I try to notice and acknowledge the feeling and see if it fades, but it keeps getting stronger to the point I have to cease the meditation.

I have a therapist and I know this is anxiety, either GAD or adjustment disorder (which is odd, considering it’s been years of constant discomfort). She’s only partially helpful in this situation because I’m looking to see if anyone can relate or has any tricks. 

It never goes away, the nagging mild “cramp” or butterfly feeling of sorts that we know too well. When it’s mild, I refer to it as “bloating” though that’s not right, it just makes me feel hard and puffy. My digestion is fine; I think it’s literally just my brain, which almost makes it harder to tackle. 

It gets much worse when I’m actually anxious about something in particular, and completely messes with my ability to understand my actual hunger. I eat small bits throughout the day and anxiously eat. I’m luckily still a healthy weight, but it’s making my brain crazy.

My goal at the beginning of every day is to “just get rid of that feeling.” Of course, it’s impossible. My life is totally consumed by my stomach.  

Literally nothing solves it. Nothing holistic, no foods, no exercise. No meditation, yoga, journaling, tea, essential oils. Eating fermented foods, going vegetarian, nixing dairy or gluten, trying FODMAP diets? Nada. Sure, eating healthy overall and doing these things routinely help alleviate stress and anxiety in anyone, but I literally have never found a way to completely quiet it and have a comfortable day. 

Since it’s anxiety entirely, I’m almost certain, there’s a reason nothing has ever shown up on any blood test or other things different doctors have tried. It’s not as if I have discovered what I’m anxious about and can solve that; it’s just chronic. 

I’m at a loss. Has anyone tried anything that finally quieted their stomach so they can just stop thinking about their belly for one second of their day? Is this something that will ever be solved? It’s exhausting, and I’m tired of this obsession. I just want to feel normal. ",anxiety,beepbeepbadoop,2018/11/26

It all started one night when I had to cover a relatively long distance driving. This is something I've done quite a few times before and never actually had any problems. 
I get into my car at approximately 22:00 and start heading towards the highway, let me be clear on the fact that this wasn't one of those 5 lane highways you see in the US, I'm talking about a pitch dark 2 lane road that goes across the woods. 
Anyway; as I'm driving past the city limit the rain sets in and I start feeling a little concerned about the condition of the road and my safety since I was all by myself. 
At approximately 22:40 the nightmare began; the storm had gotten worse, a thick layer of fog covered the road and nullified all visibility. All of a sudden I realized I was all alone, no service on my phone, not another car in sight and no civilization for the next hour and a half on any direction since I had already covered half the distance. I try thinking about something else, but it's too late; my body starts feeling warm and I feel like I'm unable to swallow, I try breathing in deep but I feel like someone is sitting on my chest. I felt like I was disconnected with reality and trapped inside my body with a horrific sense of sudden death. 
I felt like nobody could help me and started thinking about the worst scenarios I would end up in. 
There was no way I could pull over, the road was very narrow and because of the fog and the rain I had no idea where I was. I remembered that inducing a gag reflex will stimulate the vagus nerve and therefore activate the parasympathetic nervous system, this helped just enough to get me safe to my destination.

I was on Luvox for 2 years and it stopped worked, then was on Lexapro for 4 years and experienced awful sexual side effects and drowsiness which isn’t great once I have chronic fatigue. Last year I decided to change my medication again since I felt I was coping better with my anxiety. I changed to Bupropion (Wellbutrin), my anxiety surged but it was somewhat manageable - it was amazing going off the Luvox I felt like a cloud of drowsiness lifted, my emotions were stronger almost like they were dulled on the meds, and the sexual side effects stopped after about 3 months. I went on Busprione for a bit but the side effects made me feel gross.

I went overseas on exchange July-Dec and my anxiety and panic hit the roof and I really didn’t cope very well and isolated myself. I felt depressed and down too. It eased since coming home but I’m still feeling overwhelmed and fearful of things - I feel like I’ve lost my confidence, particularly in my nursing studies.

I see a psychiatrist but she suggested medications to just take when the panic hits but I think I need medication to control the daily feelings of anxiety. I’ve got a script to go back on Luvox in addition to Wellbutrin. 

I’m reluctant, I want my anxiety to lessen but I don’t want those side effects back. I’ve looked into a few alternatives but I really need the anxiety to ease by May/June for my 4 week hospital placement - which makes things more difficult.

Concerns about meds are drowsiness, sexual side effects, and lightheaded/dizziness.


I’ve looked into:
Mirtazapine (significant weight gain and sedative effects)

Nefazodone (dizziness - I have low blood pressure issues at times and risk of liver damage)

Venlafaxine (Liver issues)

If you see my previous post, basically I had severe anxiety for an entire week, with a panic attack on Monday right in the middle of it all. And that happened while I was driving to work. I had to pull over and have my husband pick me up and take me home because I was so worked up and freaked out. 

So today I had to go back to work. I was afraid of driving there again, I was afraid of talking to customers, I was afraid of getting sick. 

Last night, I had a break down. I cried multiple times about how much I just didn’t think I could do it. I looked anywhere for help. Here’s what helped me: 

- I read here and another anxiety sub for other success stories. 

- I also found the website/app 7 cups. That helped tremendously.  They have therapists you can talk to for a charge, but I used the free parts of the app. They had guided meditation (quite a few to choose from depending on topic) - free. I also talked to a “listener” (also free). Their listeners are trained volunteers who use active listening and my God it was helpful to just vent to someone else other than my husband and family. 

- Podcast: Anxiety Slayer. Since I only started listening to this last night, I have only gotten a few episodes in. But they offer stories, answer listener questions, and offer tips based on their own experiences with anxiety. 

- Reading about Dr Claire Weekes (mentioned on this sub or the other, I don’t recall which) and her theories. 

I woke up this morning nervous. I did some meditation from 7 cups, and listened to a podcast episode while I was getting ready.  I also had a decent breakfast of some toast and a banana - I didn’t overdo it because one of my biggest issues is feeling sick. But I wanted to have something in me because otherwise I get light headed. I packed another banana, an apple, and some crackers for lunch, just in case I didn’t feel up for eating much (and if I did, I have tons of options around my job for a more substantial lunch). 

I freaked out a little on my drive but I pulled over, chose another podcast episode, and listened while I drove. I did some deep breathing before I walked in. 

I was determined to stay busy. My first customer of the day was difficult, but I stuck through it and I made it the full work day with only a few minor incidents of hot flashes and light headed feelings. 

I congratulated myself on the way home, this was difficult and I did it. I had the option to leave two hours early, but I didn’t take it. I even had a coworker offer to work for me today, but I didn’t take it. I did it myself. I am so proud because this is a huge improvement from Monday.

19652,mindfulness,"A New Interpretation of Mindfulness and a Simple Proof &amp;#x200B;

Arguably the most influential non-religious movement to advance personal happiness and satisfaction in present times is the variant of meditation called ‘mindfulness’. Simply defined, mindfulness represents continuous non-judgmental awareness. But the converse of non-judgment, namely making judgments, may entail negative outcomes (perseverative judgments as represented by rumination, worry, or distraction) or positive ones (non-perseverative judgments on what to have for dinner or what route to take on the way home). Perseverative cognition is uniquely correlated with stress, anxiety, and depression, but non-perseverative thought (as well as thinking of nothing at all) is correlated with relaxation, positive affect, and feelings of happiness. Thus it may be concluded that the definition of mindfulness over-prescribes the type of cognitive operations that need to be curtailed in order to attain positive emotional outcomes. It follows that the definition of mindfulness must be attenuated to represent the avoidance of perseverative judgments alone.  By no means does this invalidate mindfulness, rather it merely determines the type of judgments we should be mindful about, and allows one to be easily mindful all of the time rather than from time to time that is the practical result of avoiding all judgment, and significantly enhances the argument for its practice.

This definition of mindfulness complements the ‘perseverative cognition hypothesis’ which associates the debilitating aspect of stress with perseverative cognition alone.  As advanced by the psychologists G. Brosschot and JF Thayer, “The perseverative cognition hypothesis holds that stressful events cannot affect people’s health, unless they think repetitively or continuously (that is, ‘perseverate cognitively’) about these stressful events. Stressful events themselves are often too short, as are the physiological responses to them. Therefore, the physiological responses during these stressors are unlikely to cause bodily harm. More importantly, many stressful events are merely worried about, or feared in the future, while they often do not happen or do not have the feared consequences. Nevertheless, the body reacts with prolonged physiological responses to continuous thoughts (perseverative cognition) about these stressors. Therefore, it is the perseverative cognition, and not the stressors that can eventually lead to disease. In scientific terms, it is said that perseverative cognition is a mediator of the detrimental effects of stress on one’s health.”

How Meditation Elicits Profound Relaxation

Meditative procedures work so distinctively well to counteract stress because they uniquely require the consistent avoidance of perseverative thought for a significant and continuous period of time, and you need to consistently avoid distractive, worrisome or ruminative thoughts for at least an hour for your muscles to fully relax. In other words, full or profound relaxation takes time. When your muscles do completely relax, you will feel a sense of pleasure or euphoria due to the release of endogenous opioids in the brain that is concomitant with profound relaxation. (Citation)

Since distraction is the preeminent cause of neuro-muscular activation or tension, it’s easy to prove this point. Simply avoid all distraction for a timed hour, and see if you can do that for two or three consistent hours a day, and merely record your progress over a few days. You will note that you will feel totally and pleasurably relaxed, a feeling that will extend into your otherwise stress filled day.

And the good thing is that you will be fully rested and have a natural ‘high’, and will not have to take a course on mindfulness, or meditation, or even for that matter read the link to the book that follows! It’s that simple.",mindfulness,reded8,2019/10/15

Everyday I have the same routine, monotony. I am homeschooled, staying alone 40-70% of my day. I go weeks without significant social interaction. I resent it, I don’t want to be alone; I want to have friends like I did years ago. There’s nowhere to go to outside of my house except for my grandparents’ house. I live in a backwoods place outside of town, and I have no friends nearby. *I don’t know if this even worth complaining about; do I even deserve these things?*. My mother gets worried and upset if I explain how I feel, making me feel guilty and responsible for her anxiety and lack of sleep. It’s useless to tell my grandparents how I feel, they’re closed-minded.

I have only one life, one story to determine. I’m supposedly in my “prime”, and it’s lousy. I’m grateful for what I have... *Is all this selfish?* I don’t know whether to go back to school, making my family upset and causing me guilt, or trudge on and tell myself “it’ll get better”. I’ve done the latter for THREE YEARS now. *Ultimately, I’m the problem. I wouldn’t have started homeschooling were it not for my social anxiety.*

But then again, is going back to school even the solution? I’m not sure how to feel about this, but something ought to change. I’m not the most patient person, and I like to do things and go places quickly, but I’m stuck on this.

I've brought this up before on several different occasions, and while it seems to be happening a little less, I can't shake my anxiety and just say, ""Don't take it that way; you know he wasn't trying to be rude."" What he's told me before is that he's not very well on social cues and that his face and tone just come off that way, that he wouldn't be surprised that I have difficulty talking to him because of it. But I feel like I get more excuses rather than him saying that he'll work on fixing it; it just sounds like he's telling me it's out of his control and I just have to learn to handle it better. 

For one, I probably can. My anxiety definitely gets the better of me and I can see how I could diffuse the situation if I had a clear head. On the other hand, though, that seems one-sided, as if asking someone to speak with more consideration is an impossible task and I'm just being unrealistic.

4663,adhd,"Complete final exam disaster Hey everyone,
So, I am a mature student, returned to school two years ago to study nursing which is when I was officially diagnosed for ADHD. It was also the first time ever that I started reading about ADHD symptoms. As I read my first book, my intention was to highlight what applied to me but pretty quickly I had to give up because I ended up highlighting everything. I realised that what I had thought of as great personality traits were rigid coping mechanisms to help me with basic functioning. I actually had a pretty great friend-fan base - I mean, having ADHD can make one feel like life is an Indiana Jones movie, and by extent get everyone around you excited and cheering. Sometimes. 

So, went back to school. It has been up and down like one would imagine with this gift (?).  

Today, just now, I finished my final-est exam and had an episode of complete obsession with getting the words of the question just right. I have extra time on exams, hell I even have ""stop watch"" time. But, the first question I touched took me two hours. I erased and rewrote &gt;40 times, sometimes because I didn't like my handwriting. I completely lost control and perspective. 

I have had this happen a few times, milder to moderate manifestation, but today it was severe. I was prepared for the exam, love the subject and tend to be very engaged in class. I am well familiar with the topics and most of the material (95%). 

The whole thing was a shit show. I had flagged my less severe episodes to my doctor and worry that meds are making my OCD traits worse (I dont have a diagnosis of the disorder but only traits). But she has not taken to it. I tried to tell her three times in the last year.

Is anyone else experiencing exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive traits on stimulants? I am on 30mg long-acting Dexedrine, but I experienced this on Vyvance too. However, I had never experienced OCD traits so much before...like ever.

Alas, I am feeling pretty crushed and feel like my efforts have been lost. And SO devastatingly embarrassed by the total loss of control. Even in the moment I wad freaking out by what was happening. I cant quite ever get a professor to take me seriously because I present as very competent and have great critical thinking skills OUTSIDE of situations where I am left with a pencil, pen and highlighters...

Bear with me, it's my first time posting something on Reddit.

  
I've always considered myself a loner, even though I have a quite some friends and a suportive family, but lately it's getting worse. I have a decent work, college is going great (about to finish my degree), family is there for me and so are my friends, but I always feel incomplete, like something isn't right and I suffer in silence.

Recently I discovered these feelings are probably inflicted by myself for being single most of my life time (I'm only 23 though). Only had 1 gf and it's been a long time since we parted ways. Everyday I look at couples forming around me, couple having fun together, couples loving themselves while I have no one but myself. 

I do miss having atention from the oposite sex, and I miss even more having someone to share life experiences with. I feel like I'm wasting my youth by not having someone. I've come to realize and accept that I'm not the most good looking guy, probably even worse than that. I've had a couple of girls show interest in me, but they always manage to be the type of person I don't identify with. 

It's starting to get the best of me, and I know it's ridiculous, I should focus on myself and my life alone, but I can't help but notice how the others are so happy with their loved one. Some days I arrive home from work really late, and I have no one to talk to, no one to ask me how was work, how was my day, not even texts to ask if everything is going well from someone.

I’ve been trying to quit my ADHD medication for sometime now but I know I would not be able to continue my job without it and life would be a constant struggle in general. I’ve been on medicine for 5 years now. I currently take Adderall 20MG 2x daily and I feel like I’m hitting a plateau once again. I don’t want to increase my dose and I really dont want to switch back to Vyvanse. I have hypothyroidism which makes my brain fog, fatigue, lack of focus symptoms worst regardless if my levels are within range. I also have sleep apnea. 

I’m concerned that the long term use of ADHD medication will ruin my cardiovascular system and have other negative effects in the long term. My blood pressure is already in the pre-hypertension range (140/90) and I don’t want to it continue rising.

My options are to quit medication and possibly lose my job, or continue taking stimulants and ignore the potential long term negative effects it will have on my body. I have a family to support so option 1 really isn’t feasible.

So I guess my questions are 
1. does anyone else struggle with this type of decision? 

2. Are there alternative non-stimulant medication/therapies that has worked for you? I.e allowed you to function at work while you taper/quit your stimulant medication?

3. If you’ve taking stimulant medication for over 10 years, what are the long term side effects that you’ve experienced?

I feel unsure if I truly need the medication, as my focus could be a result of my snowballing pile of habits that been balled into one giant mess. 


When I was still in Elementary school, I was part of the ""gifted"" group, and I think I became arrogant as a result of it.

A kid with ADHD will join our youth group. From what I've seen, he has a hard time in group settings. I'm barely a functioning adult myself, how can I help him if I see him struggling?

&amp;#x200B;

\-

&amp;#x200B;

At church we have a small youth group, ranging from age 11 to 16. It's like a casual hang out. We get together, chat, play games and sometimes do special activities (like going ice skating). There is a kid that is about to join the group who was recently diagnosed with ADHD. He's a good kid, and he is super stoked to soon be old enough to join.

It can be quite hard to involve him in a group activity. He can't sit still, oftentimes demands 100% of your attention, is oblivious to group conversations and has a problem respecting a 'no'. This made a lot of the participants dread the time he will join the group - me included. We are 3 people in charge, which would allow for one of us to pay special attention to him from time to time. But we are not enough people to offer him a constant supervisor.

The problem is, all 3 of us are just normal participants from the youth group who grew up and started taking more and more responsibility until we started organizing the whole thing. I'm 21 and I don't have any training to work with kids.

I'm afraid that the kid will have a hard time becoming a part of the group. He might even annoy some of the other people, which will make it even harder for him to make friends. Since he seems to connect with me, I decided to keep an eye on him to make sure he is doing ok, and if needed spend some time with him, but I don't know how I can really help him. I'm just a dude with social anxiety lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do to help him?

How can I react if he's taking it too far?

Are there any group activities that will be perfect for him?

Was there anything you wished the people in charge did / didn't do when you were a kid in small groups?

19448,mindfulness,"How to deal with distractions that seem to not have a rise and fall. Hello all,

I have been dabbling in vipassana meditation for a few years now, but I still feel like an absolute beginner. I think that this is because I'm not pushing myself enough and am usually only sitting for 10 minute sessions. 

From my understanding, there are two main factors of meditation; concentration and insight. Concentration allows for a calm mind and insight (governed by mindfulness) allows for discoveries about one's self. 

For the last month or so, I have hit an unfortunate roadblock in my meditation. I've been dealing with a ringing in my ears, some call tinnitus. I understand that it is not the ringing that is uncomfortable, but the reaction to the ringing. However, the ringing is making it much more difficult to enter states of deeper concentration on the breath. 

What this ringing in this ears has done is confused me on the impermanent nature of all things. It seems that the way to rid yourself of hindrances is to understand their impermanence. However, this distraction doesn't seem to be impermanent. It has arose, but is not falling. 

My question is, how do you deal with hindrances that seem permanent. How do you note the rising and falling of something that wont fall? Is everything actually impermanent? For example, one-pointed concentration practices don't seem to focus on impermanence at all. 

There seems to be too many dots that I cannot connect, and it becomes hard to simplify a goal in my brain to create a path forward. What am I trying to understand? The impermanence of nature and the laws of karma/ cause and effect? How do I more deeply understand this impermanence when things seem to not be falling. 

Thanks a bunch, I'm very interested in other views on this.",mindfulness,fugginben,2019/04/21

If you're standing still with zero progress, you're decaying. The same goes for success. It requires you to engage in the process of your personal growth at all times. And of all the things in life, what you believe about yourself can impact your success or failure. People who believe that their abilities can be improved through their hard work and dedication typically move ahead and take action without coming up with excuses. These same people also demonstrate an open mind, are willing to learn and have been seen as most successful in different aspects of their life. So how do they do it? What is Mindset? The mind is a very powerful tool and it ultimately determines who you are as a person. Also known as mindset, this thinking pattern or your frame of mind impacts how you make sense of the world as well as of yourself. So in other words, a mindset is a set of beliefs and thoughts which influence the way you handle any given situation. It pretty much dictates your personality helping you sort out what’s going on around you and what you should do about it. How Mindsets Are Formed Since time immemorial, people have thought, acted and fared differently from one another. For the most part, common sense dictates that these differences arise from the variances in one’s background, learning experiences and training. Plus, research also points in the same direction. So while experiences, backgrounds and training are all external variables, even internal variables like genetic makeup have a part to play. Most experts today agree that forming a mindset is a combination of the two. For instance, while everyone comes with a unique set of genetics, their experiences, training and personal efforts take them the rest of the way.

Here is a brief rundown of what was said:
-I was told my grades were too high for me to be immediately ready for a 504 (despite C semester averages)
-I was told that more data needed to be collected before they could go further
-RTI was suggested and they said I should do this before a 504
-It sounded like they were going to try and figure out my 504 consideration during and after RTI
-The fact that my course load is ”a lot” made them think that it was normal for my grades to be low
-I have a full diagnosis, and that seemed to have no meaning to them at all
-I was also told that “504 plans cannot give you an advantage”, which I’m pretty sure was a passive insult due to the fact that i am in a very competitive magnet school (this magnet school is part of a regular high school, you take your STEM classes with the magnet school, which is in the same building as normal HS), and competition is well established
-Here’s where it gets better: One of my teacher’s (English teacher) pulled me out of class and said “What are you doing so bad in? Why is does admin have you under their radar?”. This eventually all made sense. She had got an RTI teacher survey to complete, and was very confused as to why I was being put through RTI, since RTI is normally for people who are already failing. I am also doing pretty good in her class. 
-STEM is my strong and most favorite subject group. It’s ironic that I am really struggling in STEM this year and doing decent in English. 

I’m pretty sure I am on the first chapter of a several month long and grueling process. It sounded like no one was in a rush, except me. The fact that RTI is now in the process frustrates me, gives them more time to stall. 

I’m told that I will be pulled out of class soon to meet with an RTI coordinator and instructor. Ive thought about bringing the EDU OCR memo about the fact that RTI cannot delay services under 504, and said “look, if you guys are here to delay anything for ANY reason, I don’t need any of this RTI nonsense, and you can count me out”. I have plans to escalate things very quickly if they delay anything any further. I CAN’T afford to wait any longer. I should’ve figured all of this out a long time ago. Before high school. 

tldr: 504 plan seems to be delayed because my grades are “too high” and that “RTI should be tried in the meantime” before we move things quicker

Some years I felt wonderful, having new freedom and yeah.

Had some troubles in my life as well last three years and somehow felt it was a problem somewhere and three months ago, it kicked in badly. I have no fear to vomit anymore, I fear I die now. From a heartattack, from pulmonary embolism, aids, cancer, aidscancer etc.
I have those weird scenes in my head over and over again and I see myself dying.
I am oversensitive to everything I feel in my body and everything I feel is a sign that I'm going to die now, in a couple minutes, tomorrow.
You can guess the state I'm in: everything hurts in my body, the whole day, which makes me anxious, which leads to more hurts, which makes me anxious etc. and everything is triggering me.

When I had emetophobia I learned, that anxiety is a curve, so it's there and will disappear again and with exposure (habituation) it'll grow smaller.
One strategy was: Not thinking ""I won't have to vomit"" but thinking ""Even if I have to, I won't die"" and this helped so much to learn, not to fear it anymore.
I also had safe-spaces, where I felt good and could relax.

Now my strategies don't work anymore, I can't say ""even if I die, I won't die"", I can't learn to fear it anymore.
And I have no safe-spaces anymore, I can't relax.

Does anyone of you feel the same or also overcame it? 
How can I start to accept the idea that I will die? Is it a solution, to start thinking, that dying isn't that horrible? What safe-spaces do you have?

4466,adhd,"Making up conversations i'm excited about Ok so... I'm posting this in an alt account bscause it's too weird...

Basically,
If i'm really looking forward and/or excited about a conversation i will have, i will make up a concersation. I will give an exemple so it's clear.

I'm really looking forward and excited about seeing my GP and talk to him about about ADHD.
So what i do, i will imagine myself being in the (GP's room ? Dont know how its called) and talking to him and saying what i want to say and **rarely** talk as if i was him.
But it's only things that would really satisfy me to hear like a full sentence/response. Never like a conversation where i say something then he does then i do then he does etc. Just a loooong speach from me then what i would like for him to respond.
And i'll talk very quietly when doing so btw.
Also, i noticed i only do it when i didn't sleep which could be the worsening of my ADHD symptoms and my ""stimulation seaking"" behavior due to it.
Also, i'm not crazy, i know perfectly that i'm in my room and i'm talking alone even when i talk as him. but it's just a habit i have, it satisfies me.
Do you guys think it could be ADHD or something else ? I'm pretty sure it's due to ADHD but i'm open minded :)

4854,adhd,"Accidentally drank coffee with Ritalin once Story time because I randomly thought about it and figured y'all would enjoy this story.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so the day I got tested, I figured I'd be coming home with some meds because where I go is pretty speedy when it comes to getting you on something you need. So on my way to the office, I stopped at Dunkin and got a large iced coffee (black with extra caramel swirl \[BTW the flavor pumps at Dunkin are typically unsweetened unless you SPECIFICALLY ask for the swirl-- fun fact\]). I assumed the caffeine would be out of my system by the time we got to the meds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out I was wrong. I had work that night on top of that-- third shift. The energy boost definitely helped me through the night. I would typically get out of work at six in the morning, take a shower, check on my Facebook and stuff, then conk out until maybe one or two in the afternoon. That is not what happened. At all. I stayed up, unable to even rest, and even went so far as to have some drinks later on the next evening to help me soothe my own soul. That didn't help either. I had classes and everything!! I didn't go to bed until I had been awake for *thirty-six hours*. The only reason I went to bed is because I knew I had to. Not because I was tired. I wasn't tired at all...

&amp;#x200B;

So I've learned my lesson: caffeine and Ritalin do NOT mix. I don't even drink soda or anything anymore when I'm on my meds. Juice and water ONLY.",adhd,jocchi,2019/07/20

18835,mindfulness,"There is a particular script my mind has written, and I am having a hard time not believing it. I’ve practiced mindfulness and meditation for a few years, I had/have a really bad anxiety disorder but I basically got rid of all my symptoms through the practices I mentioned above.

Lately I’ve been having a lot of trouble with one particular thing. My career. I have chosen (or rather it has chosen me) a career in the arts.
Since I was 12 years old I have acted professionally. I’ve had a lot of success but in the past few years my success has dwindled and slowed down. I guess Im in what you would call a slump. The irony is that ever since I started taking acting seriously and really honed my craft, it feels like I have gone longer and longer periods of time without working as an actor. I study all the time, take classes etc to try to be the best I can possibly be.

Now, anything can happen, I could very well never boom another job and have to continue to work in the service industry for the rest of my life, or I could book the role of my dreams tomorrow.

The script that my mind has written is “Well, you book less and less, this isn’t working out for you,  you’ll never have the career you want, you’ll never achieve your goals. You should just quit.  Here’s all the other actors who have already had their breaks, yours hasn’t come yet so it probably won’t ever happen.”

Im tired of these thoughts, I know I can’t stop them but they feel so true. It feels like this empirical evidence to back everything up, any time I start to question it. Am I just ruminating? What should I do?

6466,anxiety,"Anxiety sucks I have been searching google about how bad it is not to have your license.Surprisingly I have seen a lot of people with or without their license say they prefer not to drive because of the stress. I'm 21+ and my family keeps telling me how irresponsible I am for not having a Driver's License yet and it gets embarrassing explaining to people on how I don't drive. I just don't know how to tell them I have crippling anxiety from the idea of driving. Especially since I was little I was afraid of two things ; Being buried alive and dieing in a car crash ( You can thank those drunk driving assemblies in elementary school, then they moved it to High School only.) The only cold hard true I realized was nobody cares about anxiety.

After hours of ridicule and judgement,I took my permit test and tried to have some one from my family teach me but they just gave me endless anxiety and they weren't really trying either. I tried to seek other options, people offered with no real intentions ( I get it ) and paying for driving school is expensive. I tried teaching myself which was going around in circles in this empty dirt lot by my neighborhood cul-de-sac. When other people drive me, I'm kinda okay but still on high alert. I know a lot of people don't like front seat drivers but all my friends and family prefer me to help them ""see"".They ask me and say I would make an excellent driver because of how alert I am. I also realized driving at night is a big no no for me I always fall asleep in the car from exhaustion.I can't do distance trips mainly because of my insomnia, I have a terrible sleeping schedule. At work it required me to throw back 1-3 monsters a day to even function as a normal person.

16830,lonely,"Long read I’ve got a long list of personal issues, and being able to form close relationships, or any in general, has always been a struggle. I try my best but I just went through a lot of fucked up shit as a child and there’s so much I have to work through. Everyone who I’ve thought really loved and cared abt me has ended up leaving me, with little to no explanation. I know I’m not always the most fun or enjoyable individual, but a lot of people aren’t. 

Until I met my best friend I never really had much in the way of friendships, at school I sat alone at lunch a lot, I spent all of my time alone in my room. After meeting her i was able to successfully make a few close and many casual friends. 

And now my best friend, who I love with my whole heart and soul, won’t talk to me anymore. We used to talk for hours, all the time. We used to do so many things together. I’ve never connected with anyone the way her and I do. I don’t even think she can stand being alone with me anymore. It’s like pulling teeth to get her talk to me. 

This all started after an incident abt a year ago where i got too drunk at a concert and ruined her night. I understand that I put her in a scary, stressful situation. I was probably annoying as shit too. After that she just kinda stopped talking to me. Said she needed time to process things. I didn’t think that was unreasonable and gave her space and time. But from then on I was just kinda out of her life. Occasionally she’ll respond to my texts(I don’t blow her phone up or anything but I try to reach out every now and then) and when her and our friends are all hanging out sometimes I’ll get invited too. Sometimes things will get brought up in conversation that I didn’t know abt, the kinda stuff I would have expected her to tell me, and it always hurts to hear that. 

I don’t even know if I’m allowed to call her my best friend anymore. I know she’s going through plenty of her own personal issues rn, and I’m always extremely understanding. But it’s at the point where I just can’t take it anymore. I feel like I’m an asshole for being upset abt it, and I tried talking to her abt it and she was basically like I’m sorry I’m just not capable of being a good friend right now I’m going through a lot. That made me feel like a jerk for even bringing it up. 
And I mean I really understand that, I’m no good at being a friend when I’m really depressed. But she won’t even give me the time of day. And we share a circle of friends so like i know that she still talks and hangs out with them, more than she will with me at least. 

I don’t want anyone to think she’s a bad or toxic person, she is really a wonderful, sweet, hilarious, genuine girl. I know she has a lot going on personally, but so do I. and I’m not mad at her. Just heartbroken that I can’t be enough for her,or really anybody for that matter. And confused as to what I did wrong. I don’t want a new best friend. I just want her back. 

I feel like I can never bring this up again with her bc she’s made her point and what else can I do. It just hurts so fucking much. Ive been crying myself to bed several nights a week for honestly almost an entire year over this. All I want is to be a part of her life again. Maybe I’m just not supposed to have friends like this.

And this time last year I felt like I was on cloud 9. I was doing well in school, had a boyfriend, had some good friends, and everything was just overall positive and happy. However I was dumped over a 5 minute phone call about 9 months ago now and sometimes it makes me upset to think about. He was my first real everything. I put in 110% effort into the relationship and he put in about 60%. I should’ve seen this from the beginning but I was so caught up into my first ~love. But anyways, since it’s been a year since I had some huge milestones with my ex, I’m feeling extra sad/lonely.

I was wondering if others have had a similar experience to me. Disclaimer: I am not very good at taking this medication and am thinking of switching, but I wanted to know if others have had success.

Although Strattera is an all-day medication, it definitely functions for me in a short-acting way. I will get a burst of ability to concentrate for about 2-3 hours and then will be absolutely exhausted afterward. However, as mentioned above, due to Strattera giving me acid reflux if I don't take it ~1 hr after eating and no earlier but not on an empty stomach and having a lot of other meds to take that require an empty stomach, sometimes... I forget. I know Strattera needs to build up in your system to work properly. If I really make sure I take it every day, is this likely to stop? Do I need to maybe up my dosage? And for any others that had similar issues and switched, what did you change to and how did it work for you?

But now i'm doing it with things in my every day life. If I was having negative thoughts while watching one of my favorite TV shows, now i'll always have those same thoughts. Just last night, when I found out Cameron Boyce died, I was looking at a random tattoo on my body, not having anything to do with him or his life, and now when I look at the tattoo, I think of his death as well. I wore a long-sleeve shirt all day as to not think about it. The negative thoughts aren't always the death of celebrities. Just examples.

I by no means expect her depression or outbursts to stop. But I do know we can find coping mechanisms which do help. I also don’t expect them to work immediately, but she just never puts the effort into learning or reading on her own. She promises she will every time we fix a fight, but then she doesn’t and all of a sudden another outburst of anger comes out of the silliest things.

Is this fixable or should I just not be with someone with ADHD like me? How much of this is about LOVE and how much of this should she be responsible for? How can I help better?

It was bad. And it is bad if you do it. Because it can't be target. Conciousness, awareness, clean mind, mindfulness (call it how you like) is not a destination - it is a way. Being it means walking that way, but in no exact destination. You can become awaken by just being awake.

When I realised it, I became calm again. It is hard to realise, our ego is so strong. And this is the biggest trap of mindfulness - making it a target, a point to achieve. It just can't happen.

4476,adhd,"First few days on Vyvanse Hi everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a first year medical student. I have been seen by the school psychiatrist 4-5 times now since the beginning of the school year. I knew that I had been depressed for years and that medical school would likely make that worse, so I told my doctor that and she started me on Lexapro. It's worked well.

&amp;#x200B;

For as long as I can remember, I have been very easily distracted and unable to do one thing for very long, but until this year it never caused me any problems. I hardly studied in college at all and still made almost straight A's. Obviously this is not possible in medical school, and it became very apparent while studying for hours every day that I simply cannot focus well enough. I made pretty good grades last semester, but I told my doc that I was worried about the increased course load this semester since I could barely keep up last semester (we went from 23 credit hours in our first semester to 29 this semester). 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I was right to be worried. Right out of the gate this semester, I crashed and burned. I failed my first test of the semester and got the minimum passing score on my second exam. I called to make an appointment with my doctor ASAP. She ended up prescribing me 30 mg Vyvanse, which my younger sister also takes. So far it seems to be extremely subtle. It comes on and wears off so gradually that I'm not even sure how long it lasts for me. I still feel pretty easily distracted while I'm studying. Is it normal for it to be this subtle? I know I shouldn't feel any euphoria or anything, but I wonder if I'm on too low a dose or if maybe I just don't respond well to it.

6528,anxiety,"Anxiety and Quitting Smoking Hey folks,

I'm having trouble with quitting smoking while dealing with anxiety and depression. 

I can go for bouts ranging from 6 to 36 hours without a cigarette and I feel slightly optimistic about quitting while in those periods. But then my mind wanders and I get triggered by a number of different thoughts and I want to have a smoke.

I'm so mixed up with my feelings about smoking and I feel like it should be easier. I know it's terrible for my health, it costs a fortune, and it doesn't actually help with my anxiety. I'm stuck in a perpetual loop of anxiety with smoking. I *want* it to help with my anxiety and I use anxiety and depression as an excuse to myself to continue smoking. So I have a smoke, then I get anxious about getting maimed by cancer if I continue to smoke, but then I want to smoke because I'm anxious... 

I've read Allen Carr's Easyway to Quit Smoking a few years back and managed to quit for a year but I slipped up and started smoking again. I've read the book a couple times since, but it doesn't seem to have the same affect. My doc recommended using an anxiety medication that happens to help with quitting smoking (I forget the name of it at the moment... Xan-something?), but I'm concerned about the side effects of the medication (suicidal thoughts/actions being one of them) and the general stigma of taking anti-anxiety medication and how it could turn me into a zombie. 

Has anyone here had success in quitting while dealing with anxiety? If so, how did you do it?

18913,mindfulness,"Sam Harris explains mindfulness I was listening to a live talk from Sam Harris's podcast (Making Sense, Ep 138), and at the end he gave a fantastic explanation of what mindfulness is, and its benefits. I transcribed it below, apologies for any typos.

&amp;#x200B;

  

It is just a fact that most of our suffering, if not all of our real suffering, is the product of us being lost in a story we’re telling ourselves -- about what just happened, or what will happen. All of our anxiety and our regret and our self concern.

 

Most of us are in a waking dream every moment of our lives, and unless you’re especially lucky, this dream has a negative character much, if not most of the time. And part of this dream is trying to find reasons that are good enough to just... surrender to the present moment, and locate your well-being here. If you could line up *all* the variables – It’s your birthday and all your friends are coming over and you’ve got your health, and your wealth, and you’ve been looking forward to this for a month and planning it, and everyone shows up, and the food is right and the drinks are right – and then that’s a moment when presumably you can say “Aha, this, the present moment, is good enough.” And yet, as a matter of our attention, we’re always missing the present moment, because we’re finding something that’s not quite right, we’re talking to ourselves, we’re struggling to even understand what our friend is saying to us because our mind is wandering. We haven’t trained our minds in any way that allows us to finally arrive in the present. 

&amp;#x200B;

Virtually everyone benefits from being able to notice the difference between being lost in thought and being simply aware of the sensory emotional display in consciousness in the present moment. Until you’ve noticed that distinction -- and this distinction goes by the name of mindfulness -- until you’ve noticed that there’s an option to break the spell of the conversation you’re having with yourself and just be present, you are by definition a hostage of whatever thoughts are going to come, all day long.  

&amp;#x200B;

And when you see how thoughts derange your life – angry thoughts make you angry, and then you say angry things, and now you’re the angry guy, in a relationship with people who no longer like you, and all of the consequences play out… It’s a super power to be given a choice to just not be angry in the next moment. Just to notice – let that thought go, and let this cascade of the neuro-physiological signature of anger go.

16801,lonely,"Sorry if you read this whole thing Back when I was in the 8th grade (I am currently in 11th, so 3 years ago), I ""dated"" a girl that I had a crush on for a long time. Basically, we never spoke, ever, and it was doomed from the start. Im posting this to get it off my chest, and because I dont want others to make the same mistakes I made. I'll start from the beginning,

~~~

In the 7th grade, I was a short buck-toothed nerd with glasses and (later) braces. I had a couple good friends that I goofed off with and talked about video games and stuff. Anyways, I wasnt a very social kid. The way my school worked was, we walked around to different classrooms but the class stayed the same. I had a crush on a girl in my class, we'll call her Nicole for the sake of her privacy, and mine. I constantly looked at her in our classes, because I thought she was beautiful. I got kinda obsessed with her, a girl I had never spoken to.

Later in the year, I had heard she was having issues with her boyfriend. So naturally, being the idiot I was, I messaged her on Instagram to try and cheer her up. We messaged back and forth a bit, mainly me trying to make her feel better, and getting to know her at the same time. In February, I had planned to tell her that I had a crush on her on Valentines Day. Ever the idiot, I caved and told her the day before. After I told her, I asked how she felt, and she said she didnt know. I went a little insane after that.. I was so desperate to know, I practically (and literally sometimes) begged her to tell me constantly, I flirted with her in really god awful ways (I dont mean anything bad, it was just very cringey), and I was just super obsessed with knowing how she felt. I even asked some mutual friends if they could try and find out. I was desperate.

In the 8th grade (specifically in September or October), she told me she liked me. I was relieved and happy, but I was anxious. I never thought it would get that far, I had no idea what to do. Still at that point, we had never spoken in person. On October 30th, 2015, I asked her out, over text. She pretty much pressured me into asking her out, because I was too anxious (and scared) to do it. Over the course of the next 4-5ish months, we still never spoke in person. It was horrible. To make matters worse, tons of people pressured us to talk in class, even my friends. We argued over text a lot, mainly about me never saying anything to her. Even over text, I managed to say the complete wrong things at the absolute wrong times. I always made things worse. Eventually, on February 13th, 2016, I got a text from her, saying that she was breaking up with me.

I very distinctly remember the moment I got that text. I was eating dinner with my family in the kitchen, and I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket. I took it out and all I had to do was read a line. I excused myself from the table and walked downstairs to my room (my room was in the basement). I read the text and cried for what must have been 20-30 minutes. After I calmed down, I went back up to dinner and acted like everything was fine. They didnt even know I was dating anyone to begin with.

There was one incident during our ""relationship"" that I regret more than anything. My school had a basketball game pretty much every friday after school. She asked if I would go with her to one, and I was anxious as hell, but I said yes. This was in like November-January, so it was cold as hell outside. I also dont like sports, at all, but she wanted me to go, so I went. Anyways, we sat in the cafeteria and waited for them to say we could go into the gym. She was sitting with a friend of hers (I didnt know they would be there), and I was obviously really awkward and quiet. We talked a tiny bit, one of the only times we've done so. A little while later, while we were sitting in the gym, her and her friend left to go to the bathroom, and I sat there alone for a bit. For some reason, I got really upset and walked out of the gym, right past the two, and out of the front doors of the school. I sat outside on a cold metal bench in the snowy weather for roughly 30 minutes. I dont know why I got upset, or why I couldnt say anything to her, But I will never forgive myself for that. The one time I really tried to put in effort, I screwed up hard.

Back into more recent events, we have a class together this year. She sits a couple seats in front of me and one to the right. A few months ago, I confessed some of my feelings to a mutual friend and she tried to get us to talk. ""Nicole"" messaged me on Instagram the day before I said I was going to message her. We talked on there for a week or two, and then we stopped talking again. I wanted to talk to her, I really did, I just didnt know what to say. I didnt want to ruin things again.

I'm sorry if you read all that, I know it got really long. I just need some help, it's been almost 3 years since we broke up and I still have wierd feelings. I shake when im near her.

I just want to stop feeling so isolated from everything. I've walked and biked around my neighborhood that I can recognize where I am by the cracks in the ground.

16969,lonely,"I feel like I'm wasting my life I guess this rant is just going to be a way to cope with my issues and I hope I get a response or something. 
I'm currently in my junior year of high school and education/learning wise I am really enjoying it. Apart from that, the thing that I like about school is that it allows me to talk to people, because like any other vacation I'd be laying lazily on my bed the whole day not doing anything, not having an incentive to do anything. Anyways (Fucking hell this is so inconsistent), at the start of high school I had a really tight-knit friend group and us always did everything, but the issue is that they all had PC's and would game all the time, and a lot of conversations would revolve around games and experiences they had and I'd always feel like I was in the backseat of most conversations. Slowly but surely I was being excluded out of conversations and other activities by them. They were still nice to me at school but we slowly lost contact, I guess it can be blamed at the slightly shitty person I am + my pessimism and Paranoia. I always used to question things, like say ""really"" or act like a smartass and I guess that caused them to isolate me. I had one friend in particular that I would always get into arguments with, a teacher actually liked our arguments because it actually advanced and helped many of our projects we worked on, but i guess that friend got really tired of arguing and now we really strayed off. That's what I think, at least, but they never told me why they started to dislike me (Ya i know life doesn't always smack info into your face), and i guess I wish they did. Probably the moment I realized that they completely didn't want me in the group was when I found out that they had multiple group chats that included everyone but me.
Anyways as the years passed one of my friends left and I guess the was the catalyst to me being pushed out of the group is the move of one the friends. He was the most wholesome and go-lucky of the group and I really think he's the one who held the group together, anyways he left and the group collapsed. 
I'm now in my junior year of high school and the group still plays games with each other, but they're more split up at school, they've all found a new friend group, and then there's me. My dumbass doesn't know how to start a relationship with anyone else, and i guess of course my dumb teenage brain thinks the majority of the other kids are twats (and some truly are). 
I'm now am completely alone with no friends inside and out of school, I don't text anyone, I just sit on my bed doing nothing most days, and even at school I seclude myself to the library during lunch. I barely communicate with anyone, I counted the amount of stuff I said in a day and the lowest I've gotten is less than 30 sentences. And Hoorah we finally got to the point of the title, I'm a lonely sack of shit and I feel like I'm wasting my teenage years, I only get to experience this part once and there's no one to accompany me or to create memories with. I am alone and I feel like shit for doing so.

6309,anxiety,"I have had GAD for all my life and I hate it Hi, My name is Gabriel and I have GAD. But cut straight to it. I was born with something where I inhaled the birth fluid and I was rushed to the NICU, I stayed there for about 2 weeks and then I came home. I don’t have any memory from when I was 0-4, I’m not sure about it but anyways my mom says when we would go to loud places like the circus, I would start crying. She tried her best to know what was wrong with me but due to a lack of knowledge and the doctors not having knowledge about my anxiety disorder (Don’t ask me about that doctors part) my mom didn’t know what was wrong.


Now that I’m older, It’s only getting worse. In kindergarten I was a positive, Happy, Playful kid who didn’t have the anxiety like I have now but now I’m a negative, Sometimes happy, not playful guy. And it’s kind of more worse now. In January of 2017 my mom gave birth to my youngest sister named ruby, 
Now that We have a toddler in the house now you know what happens, Crying. Crying that I hate. Now don’t get me wrong and think I hate ruby, It’s the complete opposite, I love her soooo much but I hate her crying and what’s even worse you may think, Well here’s the answer: A toddler in a restaurant crying and This happened last night at carabbas. I get angry and slightly tear up that I have to at least put on my headphones and turn on some music or go away from the table sometime. In fact, When I’m at any loud place I do the same reaction most of the time.
Get angry and tear a bit. Also there’s this weird thing where I’ll be doing whatever and then a flood of things come into my head, Dubstep songs changing every 2 Seconds and other things and I get pissed what that too. 
I have seen a therapist but only for 4 times and that’s it, unfortunately due to my family’s insurance I could only go 4 times.

I’ve been using mindfulness daily or every other day for the past year or two. It’s very very rare that I’m able to make it ‘work’. By that, I mean I seem unable to actually direct, let alone redirect, my focus to my breathing. Like... at *all*. I spend most of the time just pointing out that I notice my mind is not on my breathing and telling myself to focus on breathing, without actually being able to focus on breathing, even for a couple seconds. There have been a few times where I’ve been able to do it for a bit, but it’s only been when I’m already in a good mood, and when I’m about to go to bed. 

Am I doing something wrong/is there something wrong with me? 

I keep running into this problem where none of it really feels like it ‘clicks’. I totally understand that mindfulness/meditation isn’t supposed to magically make bad feelings go away or anything like that. But since it’s not really ‘clicking’, I also don’t feel it’s doing much of anything for me? When I try to connect to myself or the present/moment, it sorta feels like... there isn’t one? Like... there isn’t a self or moment or present to connect to or something. Or maybe that it’s out of reach? Not really sure how to describe that.

In my meditation practices with an app, the cues were always about looking at ourselves, almost like with an inner eye, not in a judgmental way but in an observant way. 

I can't help but think that this kind of practice is only encouraging my tendency to ruminate about myself. I've always been very cerebral and into thinking, and I've noticed that meditation developed some kind of intense hyper focus and self awareness in me, but now I am conscious that I'm just thinking about thinking and not being mindful at all. Like instead of previously focusing on external things, I am now just focused on the internal effects.  Isn't mindfulness about being able to let go? 

In my day to day activities, I can tell that mindfulness and meditation has affected me a bit since I'm less easier to anger and friends tell me I'm more willing to compromise and hear others out., but even if these things happen, I am still dissatisfied with this since I feel I haven't learned to let go of myself fully.

I went to my instructor and she advised me that it is a known issue that some people move their eyes with their attention. Apparently most people are able to maintain relaxed eyes during meditation. My eyes looked in the direction of whatever body part I was trying to focus my attention on. The more I tried to concentrate on my breath, the more my eyes would focus and the pressure would increase. There came a point when I would go to bed at night and my eyes would be so tense that it felt like they were drawn to some extreme point of my periphery when I closed them to go to sleep, making it hard for me to go to sleep. She called me to her office the next day and told me that she requested advice from a senior instructor, and he sent her these instructions.

HOW TO DEAL WITH EYES' INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS AND THE TENSION

1. Really relax the whole body and move the attention relatively slowly so you can be aware when the eyes start moving and stop them.
2. Every time you become aware of the eyes tracking the movement of your attention, you need to relax the tension this is causing in and around the eyes and further, you have to gently prioritize feeling the sensations you come across in various parts of the body.
3. Keep moving the attention (part-by-part or gentle/relaxed sweeping)
4. Try working in the lying down position sometimes to be more relaxed
5. Even when moving the attention slowly on the body, as long as you can observe sensations and remain equanimous, you are working correctly.
6. Repeatedly apply these instructions and do not become disheartened. Serious patience and perseverance are required here.",mindfulness,TrueOrPhallus,2019/08/29

&amp;#x200B;

I live in germany Berlin but come from Greece.

All my friends and family is in greece and  I live 4 years in Berlin as of now.

&amp;#x200B;

4 Months ago i broke up with my girlfriend who made me really happy and since then it goes all downhill.

I've tried to date but without success(not finding the one that i feel happy with). 

I find it really hard to date here in Germany, all of the women I've dated here are emotionless or take it as a business (want sex and anymosity afterwards).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I miss my friends my family and even my ex. I send her yesterday a message that like today we would have been 2 years together and some other things that i had in mind but she didn't reply ,just saw it.

I don't know what to do. I'm tired of cring alone everynight, I'm tired of feeling that way, I'm tired of the depression...

&amp;#x200B;

the bad thing is, that i can't go back to Greece. I moved to Germany to get my diplome and to start a career but is it really worth it, the way i feel now?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where to go or what to do anymore. at work i can't focus, my life is a shithole and the loneliness kills me day by day.

17495,lonely,"What Is The Most Important Lesson Being A Loner/ALone Has Taught You? I was lying in bed last night just letting my thoughts flow before going to sleep then I thought about the question for a while. Yes, being alone is well, lonely and painful. But it's not without its lessons learned and lessons *being* learned.

As a person who's mostly (if not always) on my own, I've learned to be resourceful. I learned to be independent. I learned that mistakes in decision-making that cause inconvenience in my everyday-living (like being short on food budget or transpo money) is on me. Which prompts on my being resourceful. If I'm buying 2nd hand goods for my living needs, I learned to be vigilant. I guess you could consider this as people/negotiation skills. I learned to clean and to cook (this is one is fun) to feed myself and keep the place tidy, ultimately living in a hygenic and healthy household.

But here's my favorite lesson that I've learned: I learned to let my loneliness **elevate** me to a more **well-rounded person**. I learned new skills, I picked up new hobbies and just began to learn, learn, learn. Nasty tear on my favorite shirt? I can **fix** my own clothes. Am I hungry? Let me **cook** myself up a nice meal. I have this obsession just learning something new everytime so that heavy thoughts of my own loneliness aren't occupying my head all the time. It makes thing ***a lot*** more managable.And your setting yourself up to be a living swiss-knife.

Other lessons I need to learn though, is to know when to ask help. There's a fine line between being a dependent person, and an independent person who knows how to ask for help when needed. I need to learn how to trust too. My loneliness/being a loner is a result of trusting too much, the wrong people and not wanting it to happen for the upteenth time which leads to why I choose to be alone.

I started out with Headspace about a year ago and I quite enjoyed it. For those who don't know, Headspace has the tendency of not overwhelming you with unnecessary nonsense, but progressively building you up, one step at a time. However after I got through the basic courses, I slowly, but surely started to pay more and more attention the incoherencies of the app. I was fighting this skepticism inside myself for a long time, because I paid for the yearly subscription and I invested so much time and energy into it already to just throw it away.  During the basic courses I always told to myself ""it'll all make sense later."" It never did. And I started to get more and more angry after every meditation session so I decided to stop. I was doing this for 7 months.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then I came across Sam Harris' Waking Up course and I thought I finally found a diamond, because Sam's reputation as a atheist I thought this will not be full of bull\*, boy was I wrong. I've done it every day, for one month. After doing Sam's course I feel I was very unfair calling Headspace an incoherent nonsense, because Sam's course is just rambling.

7009,anxiety,"What does one do for income who can't fit in any role society offers? I'm disabled from an incurable genetic anxiety disorder. I'm bored with life, but can't find any work environment I can function in. I have been officially disabled since 2015, though I last worked in 2002. I am on the medication that works best for me (after cycling through every option on the market). I have had two years of therapy in the past, to no effect. The social worker had no solutions for me, and agreed that I am not at fault for my circumstances.  


What can I do?  


I am unable to perform basic work tasks that jobs require. I can not work phones, travel (even locally), have meetings, meet deadlines, work overtime or weekends, work in dangerous environments, do physical labor, work sales, work outdoors, and other limitations. 

Working from home for yourself requires all of the things I am unable to do, so that is not a viable option either. I do not have the natural talent to create things to sell, and even if I did, I can not sell things, nor rely on ""hopeful"" income- I need guaranteed income to risk leaving disability.  


I can not return to school, as I already have a degree and am ineligible for a grant, and will not go into debt of that sort nearing 50. I also can't meet the responsibilities of classes, being unable to guarantee attendance or the ability to meet deadlines such as homework or projects. I won't volunteer, as firstly what would I be doing (can't work in those types of environments) and secondly, I will never work for free again- I was not paid owed wages for one stretch of my former career, and will not go through that again.  


To provide a good snapshot of my situation:   


Take any work environment you can think of, regardless of what it is, or where. Now consider that at any time on any day, I may have to leave on the spot without being able to communicate to others, and may be gone for up to two days (as I will end up home in bed.)  The vocational expert in my disability hearing said, in any generic workweek, he estimates I can accomplish 40% of work in that week, in a random spread.  


Tell me what employer and what job will accept such conditions?  


Clearly working for one's self would be the obvious path, but HOW do you work for yourself when you can't travel, meet with people, work phones, or sell things, and need guaranteed livable ($1200+) monthly income without being able to meet deadlines?

Last semester I failed 2 classes and was dismissed, but they allowed me back on final probation. The catch was that if I failed a class this semester I would be dismissed for two years.


Lo and behold here I am in the process of failing another class (I need to get a 90% on the final to even manage a D+). 


The reason I feel cheated is that I was only recently diagnosed with ADHD. Two weeks ago. And then 4 days ago I finally was prescribed medication (aderall xr) and HOLY COW. What a difference! Everyone on r/ADHD has their own way of describing it, but man did it feel good. 


Today is the 4th day I've taken the medication. The first day I did amazing things at work, the second day I did things around the house, the third day I did homework for 4 hours, today I've been studying for the last 8 hours.


I would say on average this semester I've been spending about 4 hours a week on school work. In the past two days I've spent 12. 


If I had just had this medication sooner, I may not be an A+ student but I at least would have had a shot at passing. I know there is more to it than taking meds and expecting magic to happen, but if the medication continues to have the same affect I don't see why I would ever fail a class again.

I tend to worry about almost every little thing ever since then, and every time I notice changes regarding stuff like physical health, I become so anxious I literally couldn’t function for hours. I get panic attacks, though I am seeing a therapist to help manage and just really, have someone to talk to.

5133,adhd,"ADHD and a constant lack of agency I had a random thought in the shower today that really made a lot of sense to me. A lot of what makes it hard for people without ADHD to understand the experiences of those with ADHD is that we don't have explicit control over certain mental faculties that neurotypical individuals do. This is most commonly seen with attention. We can't control our attention spans, neurotypical folks can but they don't need to be explicitly aware of their ability to control it. But my experiences, and many of the experiences of those on this sub, don't stop at attention. Many of the things we deal with on a daily basis involve a lack of control or agency over simple but important aspects of our everyday lives.

&amp;#x200B;

Many things are out of sight, out of mind. I can just completely forget things exist. How am I supposed to control something that just vanishes from existence?

&amp;#x200B;

My Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria makes it so neutral statements can be easily perceived as negative, so even though I am aware of the bias on my emotions due to neurochemistry it doesn't change the fact that I cannot control my emotion responses, I can only buffer them.

&amp;#x200B;

That mental fog many of us experience. I am explicitly aware of the fact I want to do something and I know I need to get it done, but trying to get it done ends up giving me a headache and I just find something like youtube or netflix to grab my attention.

&amp;#x200B;

Appetite is a big annoyance for me too. I know some people experience over eating with their meds, but I am on what I call the stimulant diet. Caffeine and Vyvanse means I have no appetite whatsoever for most of the day. I can know I am incredibly hungry, but I just don't want to eat. Its infuriating.

Sometimes however the idea of not being an active thinker makes this even worse and I feel like an tiny, controlled speck of dust in a huge game of cosmic forces, where the little bit of meaning I attach to my life becomes even more irrelevant. 

I know that I should accept this thought as well and let it pass, but that sometimes feels so important and linked to mindfulness itself, that letting it go feels wrong.

17107,lonely,"What am I supposed to do with myself? I don't know what to do with myself. 

I've got the worst paying job ever which barely pays all my bills and I've got just a little bit left to get something to eat for a whole month. I cannot save anything - by the end of the month I'm always left with nothing because I cannot save on the necessities.

I'm living in a foreign country all alone. You could say I ''ran away'' as soon as high school ended for me because I didn't want to live with my parents anymore. It's been almost a year now and I didn't really make much progress. I learned the language but not enough to work in an office or to have a serious job. 

My dad visited my aunt this week and we ended up meeting, which ended up in him trying to force me to come back to my old country to study. But guess what, it's fucking impossible there. I wouldn't mind studying at all if 1. I knew what I wanted to do in life because I don't just want to study whatever, and 2. If I could live there by myself and could afford it.

You see, in my country it's extremely difficult to get a job, whatever it may be. So of course the logical thing for me to do seemed to go abroad and start there.

And I just cannot live together with my parents. They always said they didn't have money for anything I needed. But that was a lie, I saw my dad's bank account balance once by accident and there definitely was a good amount of money there. It's much better to live alone but I don't have anyone now (not like I ever did tbh but I guess now it's more visible to me because I don't have anybody around me).

I'm lost. I don't think I'm good at anything at all. I don't see myself living much longer so even if I try to research some careers, in the end what does it matter? I want to die anyway. I don't even know what I'm doing and how I got that far with no money or help from my parents. Not like they would help me anyway, back at home they loved to remind me how much of a burden I am to them and now that I am gone suddenly everything is fine between us.

Well, it isn't for me. I'm conflicted. I don't know what to pursuit in life, and I'm stuck. My only goal right now is getting a better paying job and buying a car. But after that I don't know what I will do.

I told one colleague at work that I ''probably plan to quit'' because he asked me and I trusted him (which was obviously a mistake). Next day I was called in by my boss. They accused me of wanting to quit, and got mad because I didn't tell them. Thanks a lot, bitch.

So now at work they treat me like shit because they know I'll be gone in a month anyway. Honestly they don't even treat me like a coworker anymore and I hate it. I never liked this job but it got even worse somehow.

Sorry for the long post. I really could use some advice right now. I feel really miserable and don't have anyone to talk to.",lonely,ohnew0rte,2019/05/16

&amp;#x200B;

Nice to meet you all. I hope you're enjoying the holidays.

&amp;#x200B;

I started building my first mobile game, [Bloom](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/bloom-3), a few months ago. I'm working on it alone. I wanted to make something that would be good for relaxing, taking a deep breath, winding down. There are so many cluttered games, filled with ads and with superfluous things popping on your screen... Which is too bad in my opinion.

My two main inspirations are the [Monument Valley games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1jHHF_Wjo) and the [Alto games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk5JupHelAg). These games are very calming, and feature beautiful, even poetic landscapes.  


Here's how I work towards a relaxing game:

\- no timer, so that there's no rush

\- no enemies

\- no system of lives that you lose

\- no weapons

\- no ads

\- a minimalist approach to the gameplay

&amp;#x200B;

I've started conducting user tests to see how people react to the game, whether some points create frustration, etc. User testing allows me to be sure that I achieve to create the soothing effect I'm going for, and that it's not just my impression. 

  
This is why I am posting here today. I would love to have your opinion and feelings towards the game.

User tests take around 90 min, and require an Android phone for you to play. They are made via video call and screen sharing, so that I can see you playing while we talk.

Please [send me a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=c10v32c1u6) if you'd like to participate and help me create this relaxing game. 💚  


Have a great 2019, and thanks in advance!",mindfulness,c10v32c1u6,2018/12/29

4875,adhd,"Should I take calculus 2 over the summer? Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

First time posting on Reddit! 

To start with, I was diagnosed with ADD around age 8 and school has always been a constant battle for me. I am on a generic version of Adderall XR at a 15mg dose. Now in my second semester of studying computer science at IIT, my course load has become overwhelming. The first semester went by with its challenges but I wasn't super overwhelmed and got pretty good grades while taking 17 credit hours. This semester, I only have 15 credit hours - 4 classes - 4 labs and all of my classes are basically math centered. However, my workload is substantially higher than last semester.  Besides the regular homework, studying, pre-labs, labs, checkpoints, and my struggle with Calculus 2 in general, I also have to teach myself two programming languages (C and assembly). This is all too much for me to handle. When I get overwhelmed everything kinda starts to break down for me. Making it even worse is the fact I feel like crap after around 4 pm as the meds start to wear off. 

As of right now, I have spent three weeks with very little time for myself. Most of the time when I'm not working, I feel horrible about myself because I know that I should be working. I also feel like shit because I have nothing to look forward to besides more work. It's really taking a toll on me and it can't be healthy for me to be this stressed every waking moment. 

One of my friends, an upperclassman, recommended that I drop calc 2 and take it online over the summer through another school. I have also heard from other upperclassmen that IIT's math program is atrocious and these courses are much much easier through another school. I spoke to my counselor about this and he said that he doesn't recommend it because ""of the accelerated pace of the shortened summer semester and an online course would be hard to find."" Also, if I did, I would be below 12 credit hours which means I would be put on ""academic probation"" which I could get out of by registering with the disabilities center as having ADD and that being the reason why I am doing this. 

So I have turned to my ol' pal, the internet, for help. What do you all think I should do? Does anyone have any experience with taking courses over the summer online? Should I do it through a community college instead of online?

19199,mindfulness,"It's not possible to fully focus on 2 different things at the same time. This is the conclusion that I am coming to, humans can only use their brain to fully focus on one thing at a time.

Science says that only 2% of the population can successfully multitask, and you're probably not one of them.

https://www.businessinsider.com/multitasker-test-tells-you-if-you-are-one-of-the-2-2014-5

Let's say for example you are driving and you get a text message, if you focus your full attention on the message then you immediately start to lose control of your car, and if you are fully focused on driving, you are not going to be able to fully comprehend the message you are reading, so you have to keep rereading it to figure out what is being said.

You cannot fully focus on what someone is saying to you if you are watching TV at the same time, you are either going to miss out on what is happening on the TV, or else you are going to mostly ignore what the person is saying to you.

This is why I believe so many people have attention disorders, they are focusing on the thoughts in their mind while other things are happening around them, and so they are missing out on the present moment because they are thinking about something that happened in the past or worrying about something that might happen in the future.

People are unable to disconnect from their thoughts and so they have trouble falling asleep since you cannot focus on going to sleep if you are focusing on what you are thinking about, so when you stop thinking you start to doze off.

If you are listening to a podcast while you are cleaning your room, you are either going to be cleaning really slowly while you focus on what the person on the podcast is talking about, or else you are going to focus on cleaning your room and you are going to miss out on what the person is saying in the podcast.

I think this explains why people procrastinate so much, why they are unable to get things done and make progress, because they are trying to multitask everything by doing more than 1 thing at a time, not realizing that this is literally impossible and it is not going to get you anywhere quicker, so a lot of people are giving half of their attention to one thing and half of their attention to another thing, and they do not realize that they are just wasting their time.

Many people think they are special and they can do more than one thing at a time, but really they are just putting in a low amount of effort towards those things and they could do a much better job if they just put everything else aside.

I think this explains a lot of problems people are having trying to get ahead in modern society, there is always so many things going on at the same time, people are so distracted that they are not able to access their full potential.

I think the biggest problem is that people are thinking too much about their past or worrying about the future, and so their entire lives are being put on hold while they continue to bring up the same old thoughts over and over again.",mindfulness,theinfinitelight,2019/01/21

Practicing mindful living has been a major underpinning of my life for many years. I have over 30 years’ experience practicing Buddhist meditation and mindfulness in various forms. I have not committed very long-term to one path or teacher, but I have had times where I focused my studies and practices under specific teachers or groups.

I first read “Full Catastrophe Living” over 15 years ago, and was so excited by the measurable results of MIndfulness Based Stress Reduction and the potential this had in so many areas. My first thought wasn’t “I want to take that course!”, it was “I want to get trained so I can teach this to others!”

Because of many factors, that hadn’t happened, and I had not even taken the classes until recently. Even with as much experience as I have with living mindfully, the experience of taking these classes has deepened and enriched my practice considerably. I can’t pinpoint specifically how or why - it’s like taking this class helped weave together several different facets and perspectives, so I’m seeing and experiencing things differently, as a whole.

What’s cool is the benefit for all the folks in the class who had varying degrees of experience with mindfulness is evident as well. 

I was daunted by making an 8-week commitment, but that one night a week quickly became important to me.

Of course, there’s a lot to be said for getting together with others, and sharing our thoughts and experiences together. At the beginning of this year, I decided I was going to take part in more in-person classes and activities, and I’m very glad to have followed through. There’s something powerful about being in the presence of others that online experiences can’t replicate, even with video chatting.

I was able to find a group that took sliding-scale payments, so it was affordable. I highly recommend these classes for anyone wishing to start or deepen their practice!",mindfulness,OriginalEssGee,2019/08/14

5148,adhd,"excessive daytime sleepiness. cannot stay awake--don't know how i will survive working full time Hi, ADHD-PI here. Searched this subreddit for others who have experienced the same type of symptoms and found that my adhd might actually be a sleeping disorder. 


&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;

**TLDR**: Can't stay awake in meetings or when people are talking to me. Looking for ways to cope or advice on finding the correct doctor to help. Also looking to hear about other's experiences with similar symptoms.

&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;


To sum things up, I have had trouble staying awake in settings where I need to pay attention since I was in elementary school. That symptom has followed me into my college years and now my work life. I cannot stay awake during meetings or any time someone is trying to explain something to me. There have even been instances where I have dozed off mid-conversation and it's something that I am so self-conscious about. I know that if someone else fell asleep while I was in the middle of explaining something, I'd feel really strange about it.

&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;

On this subreddit, I always read about people being afraid to lose their jobs because of their adhd symptoms and I can't help but to spiral and think that might be my same fate if I don't fix my sleepiness soon. I've always been a hard worker(duh, we all have to work harder than most to live a normal life), but sleeping on the job is definitely not something that an employer would appreciate lol.  


&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;


 To make things worse, I'm unmedicated at the moment and just started working my first full time job in a new state so I don't have any doctors here. When it came to seeing doctors in college, I just went to the mayo clinic on campus which was clearly really convenient for a college student who didn't have a car. Now that I have to be an adult on my own, I really don't know what doctor's I need to be seeing.

&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;


* Has anyone else experienced symptoms to this extent? How did you over come it?
* Does anyone have any advice on how to navigate finding the correct type of doctor? Do I just find a primary care doctor and go from there?
* Any support or encouragement would be nice.",adhd,commitballad,2019/10/31
16644,lonely,"Bittersweet wedding coming up I’ve got a wedding coming up that is bumming me out. Two friend from college are getting married, my best friend is the best man, and my ex is in the wedding party, as well as another friend from our group. 5 of the only people I was friends with.

I realize I’m not super close with the bride or groom, so I get why I was left out of the wedding party. I should have known I wouldn’t be involved with the bachelor party or anything but was kinda excited to see all my friends again, I embarrassingly asked about it before someone kindly told me the groom didn’t want me to join. That’s totally fine and I understand it.

But since then I’m just second guessing myself, thinking they don’t really want me at the wedding at all. They probably gave me a pity invite just because I am friend of a friend. Besides, I’m going to sit in the crowd while all my friends are in the wedding party and head table. It’s gonna hurt just to watch.

I think I should just not go, let them have their night their way. It’s painfully obvious I was the one in the group that was quietly left out. It was for a reason, they don’t want me there. It’s almost selfish for me to go given the b+g’s opinion of me. I hate that I’m making this all about me, but I can’t drag myself to a wedding where I feel unwanted.",lonely,thehorror2,2019/08/28

This week I have made a lot of progress. I have successfully went out to meet with a friend yesterday ( public transportation included) after almost a year of only leaving the house for groceries.

Today I decided to finally talk to my crush after knowing him for almost two years now. The conversation is going well and he's interested in me. I also have had several phone conversations and the most anxiety I've felt is before calling/feeling slighly on edge during but nothing unmanageable.

I am going to stay at another friends' this coming weekend for my birthday and I am actually excited about the idea instead of dreading it or just cancelling like I usually would.

BUT,because there's a but : I am feeling happy which means I am feeling crazy because I have spent a year in total isolation even afraid of making social media posts : the fact that this feeling is unusual makes me feel like I'm losing my mind in a way which is my worst anxiety trigger.

This will probably sound like an exercise in futility, but I’m trying to get a clearer understanding of whether these two A-words are mutually exclusive or if one manifests the other.

I’m gonna jot down a list of my own (hoping some of them might be relatable/help think of urs) also would like to mention that majority of the angst, and in my opinion the fucken worst, takes shape in the form of impending doom with no discernible source. Anyway here is list:

- Phone calls. Whether it’s answering them or making them, they’re always a last resort. Next to no difference regarding who’s on the other end.
- Walking into houses, especially parties or groups of people. Just envisioning this one makes me sweat a lil 
- The idea of fucking up at work. Think this one could stem from a one-off bad experience, but it’s made me have to quadruple check how to do important tasks, no matter how straightforward they are (much to coworkers annoyance)
- Walking into school when I attended. This one sounds like an excuse to be lazy but sitting in the car on the way there would produce an internal ripping feeling down my sternum from the nerves, ended up taking an absurd amount of sick days
- Posting on social media. Self explanatory 
- Fucking up mid convo. Have seen this one is quite common on here. I’ll remember a bad encounter out of fucken nowhere and it will make my face physically scrunch 

I’m aware these are all textbook social anxiety symptoms, however I am not nervous when it comes to speaking in front of crowds (as long as it’s scripted), being/eating in public or meeting new people, which seem to be equally, if not more common. 

Any input is incredibly appreciated. Keen to hear about others experiences, thanks a bunch",adhd,traversebickle,2019/05/19
6549,anxiety,"Weirdly specific anxiety symptoms Hi. First time posting, long time struggling, just wondering if anyone can relate or offer some advice. Might be TMI since it's related to digestive system problems etc?

Anyway, I go to therapy about my anxiety and other, uh, issues, but for some reason I find it really hard to share one symptom of my anxiety, which also causes me really really really huge anxiety (in a really annoying cycle) - which is my digestive system.

Basically a few years ago I used to be extremely afraid of throwing up. I was sure I had emetophobia and idk maybe I did? Not sure, but like I had just started high school and I had to take the bus to get there and I guess my nervousness about having started a new school manifested itself as being afraid of throwing up on the bus. I would also be afraid of attending any big events and talks at school where I had to sit still for a long time because I was so sure I'd throw up and embarrass myself. I don't have that anymore though - it went away by second year of high school.

Now I'm at my final year of uni and let's just say that 2018 has been absolutely awful for me, and I'm really struggling with my mental health. My anxiety and depression are worse than they have been in the past three years. Now all that has again created another weird and specific digestion related fear and, honestly like you can laugh at me for this because it's ridiculous, but I'm terribly afraid of farting in public. I can't sit still in class or lectures. I can't have a movie night with my friends. Because I get anxiety attacks. About the possibility of farting.

I think it's all because my stomach is all kinds of fucked up, probably as a result of anxiety but also sometimes, occasionally, I've also suspected if I have IBS, lactose intolerancy, or what have you. And the idea of public embarrassment just becomes too massive in my head, as some sort of a weird diversion from all the other things that should be causing me anxiety, like my final project at uni for example.

Another ridiculous side note: it doesn't help that my crush is in the same class (I'm doing an art related degree and our classes aren't that big so we all know each other) and I can't even begin to handle the idea of embarrassing myself in front of them like that, which makes my anxiety about it worse! I'm pathetic, I know.

TL;DR I'm really fucking afraid of farting in public and I've been skipping class because of it and since I can't talk to my therapist about it, I'm here now.

6447,anxiety,"A new way of life but lack of support, any advice or kind words? Hi everyone, I've been posting around with everyone elses messages where I can. I just hope someone can return the favour 🙈
I've been extremely unhappy with my career, with things getting much worse since being made redundant a year ago and moving onto another job. I just don't believe in the corporate world, and being in finance I see so much hypocrisy and unfairness and I hate it. Being an accountant also means I have to be confidential, so I can't talk to many people about what goes on. I really feel like I don't want to be a part of capitalism anymore.

So I want to get out and live how I want to live. Self-sufficient as far as possible, I don't want children so it'll just be myself I need to look after (and a few pets of course), I've been looking at building a home that is better than zero carbon, and run a small cattery for income. Its going to be tough to find land and get permission but I feel like I've got to try. Otherwise, I'm literally watching the clock everyday until work ends, and I wake up every morning feeling like I want to cry. 

However, my partner and my parents don't really think it's a good idea. My parents keep telling me I earn a good wage, I can support myself in my own flat and I've studied for years to be fully qualified so I shouldn't give that up. My partner doesn't really talk to me about it very much, but her friend has said I'm being dilusional and by her supporting me it isn't fair, so I don't think she wants me to do it either. 

Obviously all of this is horrendous on my anxiety. I feel selfish for being unhappy, when I have things that others don't. And I don't feel like I can talk to anyone, otherwise all I get is negativity or a lecture on how I need to accept this is how the world is.

Background: 
I’m a 25 y/o female from Belgium. 
I went to my general medical practitioner at my lowest point, he suspected ADHD and sent me to a psychiatrist. 


My question: 

She did some tests on me and the following 5 points were mentioned in her e-mail to my general practitioner. Can someone tell me what tests she did and what ADHD charachteristics she was actually testing??

A neurological examination shows the following characteristics:
1. light balance disorders
2. Synkinesias with a slightly positive ""mouth-open-finger-spread"" phenomenon
3. positive opposition sign
4. light coordination disorders.
These ""soft signs"", which are rarely found in adults, are compatible with ADD.
5. In addition, Dr's Amen’s questionnaire was given   (USA).

- She asked me to write something down, so she could check how I hold my fingers.
- Another thing she did was: she asked me to relax my hands and put them on hers and close my eyes. And whenever she said “GO”, I had to open my eyes and mouth as much as I could.

It's due more to the fact that I've never experienced close relationships like most other people already have and my lack of life experience makes me feel stupid, left out, and yeah, I guess lonely. 

I've never had a close friend. I don't know what its like to hang out with someone all night because we just enjoy each other's company and have deep conversations about our lives. I don't know how it feels to love another person or to be in love with someone and have those feelings reciprocated. I've never experienced the joy of traveling with a significant other or sharing each other's clothes or just looking at another person and being so unbelievably happy for the simple fact that they exist. 

Seeing people talk about and share these experiences every day just makes me feel isolated. I'm sad because I've never been through these seemingly wonderful and amazing life experiences and I just feel lame. I've never been happy in that way before and it sucks seeing everyone else enjoy it, while I'm just sitting here wondering if I ever will. It definitely doesn't help when everyone goes on about how much better their lives are now that they have someone to live it with. Like, fuck my entire existence then.

I'm just a little sad and in my feelings right now. I'm hesitant to call it loneliness, because it's not like I NEED another person's company to feel happy and validated.

I usually don't even worry about these things and I enjoy being with myself more often than not, but sometimes it just gets to me.

In *Living Presence*, the author even goes as far as writing ""Presence is the human self-awareness that is the end result of the evolution of life on this planet.""

This kind of belief is a bit off-putting, especially when it comes with little to no proof to their statement. Is this really the dawning of the Age of Aquarius or is it simply a ploy to sell more books?",mindfulness,Toront0,2019/02/16

I am not currently medicated for anxiety specifically but I am on hormonal birth control which it seems anxiety comes in waves through the months. I have never done well with SSRIs or other medications. I am also in counseling and go once a month now. 


I ruined my relationships before my ex husband because of my blow ups. I self detonate. 

I was with my ex husband for 5 or 6 years. We went through very hard times. Troublesome times. Like all couples. We took time off this year. He tried to make things work. But I couldn’t any more. I broke his heart. I caused him to be homeless. He loves me. But I don’t love him. He didn’t deserve how I was so on again off again thing. He shouldn’t have to worry if I’d love him or not the next day. I hurt him so badly. I left. 

I have been dating someone for 3 months. He knows about my mental health problems. He knows about my ex. We have been taking things slowly I feel. A couple weeks ago I have a panic attack while he is over. I sleuth off to my room and hide, that’s how I cope. He didn’t know what was going on, it was out of nowhere. I tried to be quiet and I think I was. He walked in and found me sitting on the floor crying, trying to breathe. 

Today I feel like I flipped on him. Like I have done with all of my ex’s. They do something I don’t like and I get short. I don’t listen to their side. I have been so good up until this point. Today was not a good day. I deleted my Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, tumblr, but will probably keep reddit though. I do this. Every year or so I delete everything. Then in a week I build it back up. I get a new phone number. It never helps. 

I think I have to leave again. I think I need to find a job in another state and leave. I’m going to break my partners heart. We talked about marriage and babies. But again. He doesn’t deserve to feel like he has done something wrong constantly. He doesn’t deserve to feel like he has no idea what my mood will be in an hour.

3 years ago I took a flight overnight and midway through the flight I was feeling sick and fainted in my seat. I went to the doctors after I got home and I got all these tests done, I thought something was wrong with me but I was all good. I was dehydrated, sleep deprived and I had drank alcohol before the flight so my doc and I assumed this is why I fainted. After then I started have major anxiety issues, mostly I would get lightheaded and have a fear of fainting. I quit my stressful job and didn’t go out as much as I’d have panic attacks all the time. 

I fought back and read a lot on ways of overcoming anxiety as this was all new to me and I thought my life was over. I started working out, got a less stressful job, eating healthier, drinking more water, and sleeping more. My anxiety and fear of fainting is pretty much gone now. I find the major cause of my anxiety is when I don’t get at least 7hrs sleep or I stay up too late.

I have travelled since that flight I fainted on and still have issues with flying. On my last trip I didn’t faint but had a panic attack fearing that I would, I put my head in between my legs pretending like I was tying my shoe and this would help with my light headedness. It was only a 4hr overnight flight so I made it through. I am now going this summer on a 7hr flight and I’m worried already. It’s overnight and I can’t seem to sleep on planes. I’m not afraid of flying one bit but I’m afraid of fainting on the plane. Is there anything I can do/take to help me get through this. I’m against taking any medication but I’d be willing to take something to make me sleep on this plane ride. Let me know.

I worked in media relations, so I basically pitch reporters on stories and have them interview a spokesman for a client.  I have been having some success but I try to always focus on the next project ( and next pay because I have bills). My company is currently taking me through paid training to become a full time employee. It would be my first full time job ever. 

I have been able to manage my anxiety better ( clonazepom occasionally) and some pot but today it really flared up in front of my boss and I am just humiliated. 

We had a very stressful day and we almost did not make ""goal"" IE the numbers of interviews the client ordered (when we  we get goal we make more per interview)  because of some late cancellations (welcome to the news industry). I was the only one available to work from this project today so when the interviews cancelled I had to book an extra interview ( on top of the 6 that I already booked) to help our project make goal. I am happy to do so but with the anxiety and everything its high pressure high stress and I was able to get that last interview thankfully but I was really still anxious as hell. My boss kept high fiving me and telling me i saved the project. I really do not like being complimented as I just thought I was doing my job but also because getting complimented really makes me anxious. 

We went into a team meeting right after to discuss other projects, and they kept praising me for how i am early to work and have interviews booked early. Which i think is part of a job that pays a good mount of money but they were being really nice. 

I had a training session with my boss afterwords but he had to push it back an hour to finish some other tasks. I did not mind. But when we began our training session I noticed my anxiety starting to flare. My back tightens, stomach feels like its about to burst, I am sweating like hell and fidgeting all over the place. I excuse myself from the meeting but I came back and was still freaking out. My boss noticed it and said ""I hope you feel better."" and I apologized.

There was a study published years ago that says ""about 47% of waking hours are spent thinking about what isn’t going on"" ([https://news.harvard.edu/](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/11/wandering-mind-not-a-happy-mind/)). It describes how people are spending almost half of their waking hours being lost in thought, thinking about past, future or things that might not even happen and as a result it leads to an unhappier life.

I've recently started meditating using the Headspace app (not sure how the community feels towards the app as I'm very new here) and there they always emphasize that it's all about being present and being in the moment and they use breath mindfulness to train the mind to be more present and to focus on one task at a time. I've gotten to a session now where they recommend practicing this in everyday life even when you're not meditating.

An example would be my morning routine - I wake up, shave, take a shower, prepare breakfast, brush teeth, go to the bus. Now, all of these mundane tasks are so routine that I just do them automatically. When I shave, I don't think about shaving, I'm thinking and planning the shower. When I shower I'm already thinking about the breakfast and the most efficient order in which I'll prepare my breakfast. When I'm on the bus, I don't think about being on the bus, I start to prepare a to-do list of all the things I'll need to tackle first once I arrive at the office.

What I'm struggling is - where is the balance? Is the end goal to be 100% present all the time no matter how mundane the task is? And if so, do we then need to start scheduling a separate time in the day where we're able to zoom out, reflect and actually think and wonder?

4197,adhd,"Medication, Emotional Regulation, Creativity Hi all. 

Long-time lurker, first-time poster here :)

I've (30F) just been diagnosed with ADHD, though I've suspected it for many years. I reached a dead-end socially, professionally and romantically (around the same time...), and decided it was time to but my pride aside and ask for help and guidance from my doctor. 

I'd say that the telltale signs of ADHD (either trouble focusing, or hyper-focusing, other-worldly sense of time, wandering mind, trouble sitting still, etc.) were 50% of the reason I ended up at the doctor's office, but the other solid 50% had to do with lack of emotional regulation. 

When I get overwhelmed, my emotions take the reigns and I feel helpless to them. They can be nasty. Mixed with impulsivity, this has led me to compromising situations in work, home and social life, and doesn't line up with my core values and the future I want for myself. I know this can be an issue with ADHD, but wanted to emphasize that the emotional aspect makes up at least 50% of my most-pressing issues. 

So the doctor diagnosed me with ADHD and I will start medication (Ritalin) in a few weeks' time. She has also mentioned that I have many hallmarks of Borderline Personality Disorder (which I agree with) but that we should treat the ADHD first and the possible-BPD afterwards. Her reasoning being that stimulant medication can take the ""edges"" off wild emotional swings, and might be enough to nip my emotional regulation issues in the bud. 

I'd like to ask if anyone here has experienced enhanced emotional regulation as a result of ADHD medication? As a side question, I'd also love to hear how medication has affected your creativity- it's one of the main things I value about myself, so I am nervous about losing it- but I have such a hard time finishing things, that it seems worth a shot at this point.

5134,adhd,"Kaiser is telling me it will take them between 4-6 months to diagnose me... I've always struggled with ADHD symptoms and now  I finally decided to do something about it because it's become unbearable. I am worried about my performance at work and other aspects of my life where I am unproductive and completely unable to focus etc. 

Today I saw a psychiatrist at Kaiser, (2 weeks after they had me talk to a therapist) and she said that it is likely that I have it and have the symptoms, but they don't make a diagnosis until they assess you. She told me someone from the dept would reach out to me to set up a two hour appointment in mid February- early march (yes 3 months from now bc they are busy)   where different specialists will interview me and that I'd have to take a questionnaire-type test and a drug test. Then, after that, she said it takes them about a month to get back to me.. my question is have any of the of you experience this? is it normal for a provider to take 4-5 months to be able to assess you? I dont think I have any other options because it's kaiser...  I am worried because I don't want to wait that long, it's affecting my life now :/ any tips are appreciated. ",adhd,Low_Aside,2018/12/13

4199,adhd,"Starting to think maybe my ADHD is misdiagnosed? Or is it just treatment-resistant? I was diagnosed with ADHD after my first year of college, and have been steadily increasing my dosages and switching to stronger medications every weekly visit with my dr. 

I’ve worked my way from Concerta 18mg (the weakest dose of the weakest stimulant) all the way to 20mg Adderall (the second-strongest dose of the strongest stimulant. I am aware that Desoxyn/Methedrine is available in the US which is technically the true strongest stimulant, but it’s not available here) and I still feel NO EFFECT from any medication.

I was previously diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, but I decided to cease treatment for it on my own after also seeing no results from the medication I was on.

Could it be that my ADHD symptoms are actually just a manifestation of either Anxiety or even something I haven’t been diagnosed with yet? 

I looked up disorders commonly misdiagnosed as ADHD and apparently anything from anxiety/depression/bipolar/BPD are all very commonly misdiagnosed as ADHD and that ADHD can commonly be misdiagnosed as one of those as well. I think I actually that if you combine all my anxiety symptoms and all my ADHD symptoms, that the total symptom list matches very scarily close with BPD which is currently still untreatable...

But this also could be just explained away as “treatment resistant” ADHD as well.

I’m just unsure what to think of that though. Because if someone without ADHD took 20mg of Adderall I’m positive they would feel the effects, but I don’t feel anything at all from it. Even if I up it to 40mg which is technically an overdose by 10mg, I only end up feeling a little bit like I’m in a trance and have no concept of time, but I find no relief of my symptoms at all.",adhd,AnonThrowAwayAcc727,2019/09/22

-Positivity get you positive emotions.

In that regard, positivity is superior to mindfulness because having positive emotions is superior to having neutral emotions.

E.g : let's say 3 kids are going to the dentist.

1st kid thought : it will hurt &amp; I will cry.

2nd kid thought : it doesn't hurt but it doesn't make me happy.

3rd kid thought : I will be a hero &amp; a great warrior.

In this example, we get to see that practicing mindfulness sure, help to appease your negative thoughts, which is good enough.

I think a lot of the daily duties that come alongside having a brain with suppressed congnitive functions make life ridiculously hard. 

What if there were a platform (app) where people with adhd could partner up with a stranger who wants to help, kind of like an alcohol sponsor. 

So this partnership is kinda mutually beneficial. The neurotypical partner could keep the adhd person in check, remind them to stay positive, remind them of random things like appointments or to call your mum.  They could even be a study partner who can work around you. 

The adhd person provides an alternative insight into life, adds some perspective which could also possibly help the neurotypical person.

4940,adhd,"Thank you for validating me Hey r/ADHD. I discovered this subreddit earlier today and just kept reading and reading and reading. There were so many stories, inspirations, and tips.

You see, I was diagnosed at 19, only a few years ago. Even though I originally went to a psychiatrist for depression and anxiety, he still saw the signs in me. At first, my family and I were surprised, they never saw the obvious signs in my childhood. I was the opposite from the stereotypical ADHD kid.

I'm lucky to have grown up performing excellently at school. I didn't really work hard for it, it just so happened that a lot of what interested me was what they were testing us on. I was far from responsible, but everyone just thought I was lazy. You know the archetype of the person who was naturally gifted without studying? For a long period of time, everyone was telling me that I was that. I barely studied, but was able to graduate with honors. 

Then college happened. I'm THAT kid who's grades radically dropped after changing environments. At first it was fine, majority of the subjects being taught in the first two years were somewhat covered in high school so I still kept up my barely studying attitude. It wasn't quite failing, a little above passing maybe. When I started taking majors, that's when the noticeable changes in grades popped up. I only started studying the night before, or even hours before major exams. I was barely passing, and at the end of the semester, failed multiple core courses. 

I guess you could call that my wake up call. I fell in a hole and sought a professional. That's when I was diagnosed. Everything made sense. So much behavior from my childhood that was attributed to immaturity suddenly had an explanation. My psychiatrist had me start with antidepressants first and while it did improve me a bit, it was clear that more intervention was needed.

A year later he prescribed 10mg Methylphenidate. Holy cow did it make so much of a difference. So much so that I didn't need to take the antidepressants anymore since a lot of my depression and anxiety is rooted from the guilt of not performing well in school.

That was all before I found out about this subreddit. Reading through here was such a wonderful experience. I have certain behaviors that my family dislikes and finds incredibly annoying, and because of all of you I have more ways to explain my symptoms and hopefully work better with them to manage it. I don't really know anyone else with ADHD in real life and I like having this community to relate to. This is great.

What's the reason for the flair? I guess it's for life in general. I'm doing pretty great right now every since starting my ADHD medication, my Psychiatrist is great (I'm very lucky to have found a good one on my first try!), and I'd love to participate here. I have more room to grow but I sure as hell am better off than I was before.

However, in this frame of mind, I can not rationally take in and digest good advice. Instead, some part of me, my ego gets wrapped up in my anxiety and convinces me that my unique worry is not being reflected or detailed exactly and I take my cue to continue with catastrophic thoughts. Instead of reflecting that this has happened time and time again with a different set of variables, I fool myself into thinking this situation is different and therefore worth being distraught about.

I’m 19 (F). I’m quite fit, always busy and have hobbies that keep me physically and mentally stimulated and this sincerely helps me and my battle with anxiety for nearly 6 years now. For this year, I began having pains on the left side of my chest. I had never experienced anything like it before, not ever during when I felt gushes of anxiety or even during panic attacks, but it began to get more frequent and seemed to correlate with my anxiety levels. 

I believed at first it was heart palpitations, as this is something I usually get minus the pain but ignored it. It began to get worse one night to a point where I honestly felt like I was going into a cardiac arrest. It felt like my heart was being squeezed and I felt so much pressure around my chest, as if it was going to burst. I literally cried for hours because of the pain. I cannot compare it to anything else, it was incredibly painful beyond words. 

I went to a GP and even A&amp;E because the pain got so bad. Everything was okay, tests came back fine and they said that it was my anxiety causing it, as I suffer from very bad anxiety and have been for years now. They just sent me away, increased my dosage of medication not long after and everything seemed fine.

It came back tonight after months of disappearing, and it was when I was only experiencing mild anxiety. Now I’m bed ridden with pain and terrified once again.  

I don’t know if anyone else gets this who experiences anxiety. I really need reassurance or advice, for I don’t know what is going on and if this is truly anxiety related or could be something else. I’m so panicked and afraid to go to another medical professional if I’m making something out of nothing. I just need a virtual hug that someone could help me with this.

4984,adhd,"How to sleep on time??? I really need help for sleeping on time. I haven’t gone to classes for the past week because I constantly just oversleep since I’m sleeping at 5am. I can’t manage to sleep earlier. And when I wake up late, I feel really bad and unmotivated to do any work. 

A huge problem is that I play video games a lot, and then I play until 5. It’s so bad, but I can’t figure out a way to not play. I could try playing earlier but at night when I’m tired, I just want the adrenaline of playing. I don’t know how to break out of this cycle. If I decide to not play after 2 am for example, I’ll just end up browsing reddit or reading fan fiction until 5 am again not.

Any idea on what I can do to stop this cycle? ",adhd,dtorssegment,2019/03/14
19367,mindfulness,"“Reset” anytime Feeling overwhelmed and stressed is inevitable, so I would like to share something I practice that has been helping me. I like to “reset” whenever I feel my mind is not focused or is overwhelmed with thoughts. If you have practiced meditation, it is super easy. Just stand there, close your eyes and focus on breathing. Doing this even for a couple of seconds, your eyes will see clearer and your mind will feel focused. Meditating for longer periods of time is still beneficial and recommended, but this is just a way to catch a quick reset for your mind if you have trouble with your sporadic thoughts or trouble focusing.

I find I burnout super quickly if I try to things that are good for me in ways that are good for me. For example, yesterday I ate 3 biscuits, half a bag of chocolate buttons, some toast, and lots of coffee. I drank the coffee at 5 in the afternoon and ate the rest sitting in bed at 1am. Now obviously eating that sort of food is shitty for me and eating at those irregular times isn't helping either. I've tried eating healthy and regularly but I never last longer than a week before I get distracted or bored and it all falls apart. My question now is do you think it'd be better for me to start eating the same terrible crap but at actual meal times at an actual table or prioritise eating things that are good for me but doing it at random times?",adhd,apparently_thorny,2019/08/22

We are looking for people who are willing to complete some online questionnaires about employment and well-being which we hope will help us to improve services for assisting people with mental health difficulties to obtain and retain employment.

We are developing an employment questionnaire for people with personality disorders; however we are looking for people from all backgrounds to complete it. That means you do not need to have a diagnosis of personality disorder – you just need to have an interest in completing the online questionnaires.

The questionnaires will only take about 5-10 minutes to complete online. For your participation, we’ll donate £1 on your behalf to a mental health charity (Young Minds: Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Health, Mental Health Foundation, or Rethink). We have now had over 1000 people take part in our research - that's over £1000 donated to mental health charities! A lot of our responses have come from Reddit so thank you!

6285,anxiety,"No anxiety until I start thinking about anxiety... This might sound weird, but I can be in a store, in a staff meeting, at the dentist, etc... and doing completely fine. Then I'll think ""oh no, what if I start to get anxious?"" and then the anxiety starts to hit and i think ""why they hell did i put myself in this position.. why did i do this to myself?"" and i'll cause myself to have a panic/anxiety attack. These usually feel like i cant breath, i get dizy/need to sit down/drink water, and I usually want to just bolt from whereever I am...

I'm prescribed ativan if I need it but haven't taken it yet since these attacks usually happen in public settings and I dont have it at the ready... I also recently started therapy. And I have CBD oil.

I just wish I could go back to when i didn't obsess about potentially having a panic attack.. I wish there was a way for me to focus on something else or talk myself down when I start to think about getting anxious.

Does anyone else deal with this form of anxiety? Any coping methods that have worked for you?

For over ten years, cigarettes have calmed me, given me something to do with my mouth and fingers, and also been an excellent excuse to leave a social situation for 10/15 minutes to get a break from people, or at least deal with the smaller, more quiet smoking area.

19118,mindfulness,"Meditation/mindfulness heuristics I’ve heard a few sayings/cliches that though simple function as shortcuts for the dharma - establishing mindfulness, dealing with hindrances, and so on. I’m interested in any other sayings that y’all have heard that are helpful to you. 

A few examples that come to mind are the following. These mostly deal with negative thoughts and aversion. 

- “Imagine how you would deal with it if you knew you’d feel this way for the great of your life.” (Thereby making it easier to accept a state of aversion or suffering.)

- “Joy is not illegal!” (I heard Robert Thurman say this once when talking about how seriously Westerners take trying to achieve happiness, and how, ironically, such seriousness makes happiness less likely.)

- Repeat your negative thoughts in the voice of the Swedish Chef from the Muppets. (Hat tip to Jeff Warren. Not sure if this is a meditation tip, strictly speaking, but it’s great nevertheless.)

- Be aware of the distinction between *experiencing* negative emotions and *entertaining* negative emotions.
