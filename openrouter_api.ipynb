There are times where I'll be talking with somebody (this can be any person, talking about anything. I've had it happen with teachers, relatives, and even some of my closest friends, so I don't think its related to who I'm talking to), and some kind of response is prompted, I come up with an answer/response, but there is something that is physically not letting me say the words. I just stand there with my mouth open trying to say something but I physically can't, and its gotten bad enough that I avoid certain interactions out of fear that it's going to happen again.

I left because I was tired of retail hours and I am recently married, so I wanted a better work-life balance. I had no idea that leaving that job and starting a new one would cause debilitating anxiety. For about 3.5 weeks now, I have woken up every morning with extreme nausea and vomiting. This has caused me to quit literally three new jobs since April. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to cope. I just started taking lexapro about 1.5 weeks ago, and I have noticed that I am feeling better. I have a job interview on friday for the same line of work i used to be in, just the competitor. I'm hoping the fact that I'll already know how to do this job will put me in a better place. But what do i do? I'm worried my husband is going to start hating me. He ended up taking me to the hospital last week cause i started vomiting blood and got diagnosed with gastritis, doctor said that it was caused 1000% by my anxiety. what do I do? how can i find a job and live like this?\",\n",

I experience a lot of dissociation when I’m anxious, my bodies way to cope. Usually when driving I start to freak out when I dissociate so it makes it worse but today I said fuck it this feels kind of cool. Trying to enjoy the feeling actually made it less and less prominent. Also I have anxiety that when I dissociate I’ll hit another car or something dumb, I literally tried to make myself hit a car and it wasn’t possible my brain stopped myself every time. It’s really crazy how the brain works. Accept the feeling and enjoy it no matter how shitty it is.',\n",

I experience a lot of dissociation when I’m anxious, my bodies way to cope. Usually when driving I start to freak out when I dissociate so it makes it worse but today I said fuck it this feels kind of cool. Trying to enjoy the feeling actually made it less and less prominent. Also I have anxiety that when I dissociate I’ll hit another car or something dumb, I literally tried to make myself hit a car and it wasn’t possible my brain stopped myself every time. It’s really crazy how the brain works. Accept the feeling and enjoy it no matter how shitty it is.\n",
